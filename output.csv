And then they get to a spot on the land.""On Sunday, the rain was pouring down as the BBC reached the camp.The entrance was cordoned off by police and the rubble of what might have been some kind of gatehouse was strewn across the ground.Texas Gov Greg Abbott vowed on Sunday that the mission would ""stop at nothing"" until every missing person was found.Congressman Chip Roy, who represents the area, acknowledged the devastation while urging caution against premature blame.""The response is going to be, 'We've gotta move all these camps - why would you have camps down here by the water?'"" Roy said.Camp Mystic has been operated by the same family for generations, offering girls a chance to grow ""spiritually"" in a ""wholesome"" Christian atmosphere, according to its website.But the beauty of the Guadalupe River, which draws so many to the area, also proved deadly.The floodwaters arrived with little warning, ripping through the picturesque riverfront area that is home to nearly 20 youth camps.",Positive
How Trump's tariff chaos could reshape Asia's businesses The US president's tough stance on global trade is shaking up the region's crucial supply chains.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/czeyrrnjjnpo,"– It's unclear what happens next.The president said on Friday that the US government is to start sending out letters with details of higher tariff rates that will take effect on 1 August.He said as many as 12 letters will be sent out over the coming days and the levies will range from ""60% or 70% tariffs to 10 to 20% tariffs"" but did not name the countries due to receive them.So far, semiconductors are exempt from tariffs but Trump has threatened levies on them several times, and that uncertainty is making it near impossible for businesses to plan for the future.Last week Bloomberg reported the White House is planning to further tighten controls over artificial intelligence (AI) chips by restricting shipments to Malaysia and Thailand to crack down on suspected smuggling of the technology to China.The US Commerce Department did not immediately respond to a BBC request for comment.The US-headquartered GlobalFoundries is contracted by some of the world's biggest semiconductor designers and manufacturers - AMD Broadcom - to make their chips.Its factories are spread across the world, with many in Asia, from India to South Korea.So far, semiconductors are exempt from tariffs but Trump has threatened levies on them several times, and that uncertainty is making it near impossible for businesses to plan for the future.Asian economies are reliant on US exports to be much higher rate tariffs, although Trump has threatened Tokyo with an even higher rate.Japan and South Korea have been pursuing trade negotiations during the pause, although Trump has threatened Tokyo with an even higher rate.China has said it has offered to buy more US goods than it ""should be zero.""",Negative

Is the UK really any safer 20 years on from 7/7? The British state has an evolved and sophisticated suite of powers and tools - but the shape of the threat has shifted.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c14e77je72mo,"– 20 years since 7/7, are we any safer now than we were then? The 7/7 attacks were the worst wake-up call for the UK's then outdated counter-terrorism operations.Until that day in 2005, the UK's response to terrorism groups was heavily influenced by the experience of combating the IRA, which organized itself along military lines.Al-Qaeda (AQ) was also broadly organized in a military way— directing its adherents, including the 7/7 bombers.But the key lesson from 7/7 was that this analogy only went so far. MI5 and the police realized they had to work closer together to penetrate AQ's cells.The agencies were focusing on a huge bomb plot they knew about—Operation Crevice. But the brutal fact was that they had no idea that Khan could be a serious threat because he had been discounted as a priority for further investigation. MI5 captured in extraordinary detail the gang's preparations.The success of Operation Overt shows that plots could be disrupted early.The reason why the future 7/7 ringleader was put to one side in 2004 was that there was no substantial intelligence that he was actually planning an attack.The agencies were focusing on an al-Qaeda recipe for a liquid bomb disguised as a soft drink—and they planned to blow up transatlantic planes.MI5 captured in extraordinary detail the men Khan was seen meeting.Despite being seen meeting other men of real concern, he was never made a priority for investigation.Listen to the series State of Terror on BBC Radio 4 from later today.",Negative
A video game on 'gold diggers' is fuelling a sexism debate in China So heated was the criticism that creators quietly renamed the game Emotional Anti-Fraud Simulator.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0rvzw1jk2do,"– ""If you have a rich boyfriend, you are called a gold digger. If you try to make yourself look pretty, you are called a gold digger... Sometimes the label is used on you merely for accepting a drink from someone,"" she adds. The game's lead director, Hong Kong filmmaker Mark Hu, has now been banned on several Chinese social media platforms.The players in the live-action Revenge on Gold Diggers are male protagonists lured into relationships by manipulative women who are after their money—how the man responds shapes the rest of the story.It topped the gaming platform Steam's sales list within hours of its release in June but controversy quickly followed.It is now among China's top 10 titles for the PC platform, surpassing even Black Myth: Wukong which is reportedly the most successful Chinese game of all time.""I don't get why people are upset about this. If you aren't a gold digger yourself, why should you feel attacked by this game?"" says a 28-year-old man,""I actually thought the game's creators are very bold.Some people online have suggested the game is inspired by the real-life story of a Chinese man, known as Fat Cat on the internet, who jumped to his death last year after a breakup.Police have dismissed these allegations.Women who spoke to the BBC worry that the video game perpetuates problematic gender norms in China, where society believes women belong at home, while seeing men as the primary breadwinners.The game's creators insist they never intended to ""target women""—rather they wanted to facilitate ""open dialogue about emotional boundaries and the grey zones in modern dating.""I don't find it targeting either gender,"" says 31-year-old Zhuang Mengsheng, who used a pseudonym to speak to the BBC.It topped the gaming platform Steam's sales list within hours of its release in June but controversy quickly followed.",Negative
First round of Gaza ceasefire talks ends without breakthrough,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/crenx445170o,"– The latest round of indirect ceasefire talks between Israel and Hamas have ended without a breakthrough, a Palestinian official familiar with the negotiations told the BBC.According to the official, the session lasted for nearly three and a half hours and took place in two separate buildings in Doha.Messages and clarifications were exchanged between the two sides through Qatari and Egyptian mediators, but no progress was achieved.Hamas has said it has responded to the latest ceasefire proposal in a positive spirit, but it seems clear there are still gaps between the two sides that need to be bridged if any deal is to be agreed.The Israeli government may also not have shifted to any major degree.As he was leaving Israel for the US, Netanyahu said he was still committed to what he described as three missions: ""The release and return of all the hostages, the living and the fallen; the destruction of Hamas's capabilities - to kick it out of there, and to ensure that Gaza will no longer constitute a threat to Israel.""The question now is not only whether the talks in Qatar can achieve a compromise acceptable to both sides - but also whether Trump can persuade Netanyahu that the war must come to an end at their meeting on Monday.",Negative
Hamas security officer says group has lost control over most of Gaza,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4gk79xlzwjo,"– A senior officer in Hamas' security forces has told the BBC the Palestinian armed group has lost about 80% of its control over the Gaza Strip and that armed clans are filling the void.The lieutenant colonel said Hamas's command and control system had collapsed due to months of Israeli strikes that have devastated the group's political, military, and security leadership.The officer was wounded in the first week of the war, which began after the Hamas-led attack on Israel on 7 October 2023, and has since stepped away from his duties for health reasons.He shared several voice messages with the BBC on condition of anonymity.The officer confirmed that Hamas had placed a large bounty on Abu Shabab's head, fearing he could become a unifying figure for its many enemies.He also said Abu Shabab ""maintains good ties with Mohammad Dahlan's camp.""Let's be realistic here - there's barely anything left of the security structure.Most of the leadership, about 95%, are now dead... The active figures have all been killed.So really, what's stopping Israel from continuing this war?""""Logically, it has to continue until the end.All the conditions are aligned: Israel has the upper hand, the world is silent, the Arab regimes are silent, criminal gangs are everywhere, society is collapsing.""So really, what's stopping Israel from continuing this war?""",Negative
