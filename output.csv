"Trump may have backtracked, but this is far from over There is an anxious wait to find out what comes next - and if a currency war will follow.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c20xxv3y9r2o,"– President Trump's ""4D game of chess has left China in check""—but even accounting for the president's roll back, the US has still erected a massive protectionist tariff wall, not seen since the 1930s.""The world is left with a universal 10% tariff, irrespective of whether that country (for example the UK or Australia) actually sells less to the US than the US sells to it.Tariffs at these sky-high rates are massively hitting business between two nations which together account for around 3% of the entire world's trade.The visible tangible consequences of all this will become very real very quickly: Chinese factories will close, workers will stroll from plant to plant looking for work.China probably needs those countries just to stay neutral, and carry on soaking up its exports.What we saw last night was the trade turmoil spread to credit markets, especially the US bond market, having already hit share prices.Indeed there was an invaluable reveal for the game theory of this conflict.The rest of the world has seen Trump's team struggle to explain tariffing penguin islands or poor African economies and the President himself recirculating the suggestion he was crashing stock markets on purpose.China is the second biggest holder of US government debt in the world and if it chose to, dumping all that debt would be catastrophic for America.The US does have the Federal Reserve, which does have some power to tranquilize bond markets.But right now it does not look like its chairman Jerome Powell will ride to the rescue.",Negative
