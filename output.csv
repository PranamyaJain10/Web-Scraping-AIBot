He said the 30-hour truce would last until 22:00 BST on Sunday (00:00 Moscow time), adding that Russian forces should be prepared to respond to ""any possible violations."" Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Kyiv would adhere to the truce, but accused Moscow of breaking it.""If Russia is now suddenly ready to truly engage in a format of full and unconditional silence, Ukraine will act accordingly - mirroring Russia's actions,"" he said. Putin announced the temporary truce at a meeting with his chief of general staff, Valery Gerasimov.""Based on humanitarian considerations... the Russian side announces an Easter truce. I order a stop to all military activities for this period,"" Putin told Gerasimov.""We assume that Ukraine will follow our example. At the same time, our troops should be prepared to repel possible violations of the truce and provocations by the enemy, any aggressive actions.""The Russian defense ministry said its troops would adhere to the ceasefire provided it was ""mutually respected"" by Ukraine.It is not the first time a pause in fighting has been suddenly announced—a previous attempt at a ceasefire during Orthodox Christmas in January 2023 fell apart after both sides failed to agree on a proposal. Reacting to Putin's truce announcement, a Foreign Office spokesman in the UK said: ""Now is the moment for Putin to truly show he is serious about peace by ending his horrible invasion and committing to a full ceasefire, as the Ukrainian government has called for—not just a one day pause for Easter.""",Neutral

"The mother and children trapped between two conflicts Fighting between rival forces resumes in South Sudan, while a full-scale civil war rages in neighbouring Sudan.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cnv5rm71r28o,"– When civil war erupted in 2013, two years after it gained independence from Sudan, to become the world's newest nation. But the post-independence euphoria soon dissipated, when a power struggle between President Salva Kiir and his deputy Riek Machar triggered a civil war that claimed the lives of an estimated 400,000 people and forced 2.5 million people to flee their homes.Ms Williams, a 33-year-old mother of five, is from South Sudan.She was forced to flee when civil war erupted in 2013, two years after it gained independence from Sudan, to become the world's newest nation.In the past two years, the conflict in Sudan has claimed more than 150,000 lives, forcing more than 12 million people from their homes, and turning large parts of Khartoum into rubble.Ms Williams has not heard from her family in the town.Ms Williams wants to return to her hometown, Nasir, in Upper Nile State.However, it is unsafe to travel to Nasir - a strategically important port town along the Sobat River - as it has turned into a war zone.""There's conflict ahead of us,"" she tells the BBC, holding her four-year-old daughter while gently rocking her one-year-old son.Her voice is steady, but her eyes are heavy - carrying the weight of war, loss, and uncertainty.Government troops and the White Army - a militia allied with Machar during the civil war - have repeatedly clashed in Nasir, with reports of heavy shelling, ambushes, and displacement of residents.Ms Williams has not heard from her family in the town.",Negative
Inside Elon Musk's government-subsidised Texas headquarters The tycoon and Donald Trump advisor has moved his businesses from California to a mostly rural central Texas county. What do the neighbours think?,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c9de28n71ldo,"– It seems like an unlikely address for a high-tech hub, but that's exactly what Elon Musk, the world's richest man and one of President Donald Trump's closest allies, hopes it will become.Court filings indicate that a large metal building finished in the last few months will be the new headquarters of X, his social media platform.A short distance away, a large logo of the Boring Company, Musk's infrastructure company, is plastered on the side of another headquarters. And across FM 1209 is a rapidly growing SpaceX facility which manufactures Starlink satellite internet equipment.Like most technology tycoons, Musk had long made Silicon Valley his home and headquarters.Once a supporter of the Democrats, his move to Texas is part of a larger tech world trend and also appears to reflect his own transformed ideological views.The grandly named Hyperloop Plaza sits in the middle of the corporate buildings, and is home to the company-owned Boring Bodega, a bar, coffee shop, hairdresser and gift shop.Although the Musk development is technically outside of the city's limits, it's close enough that Texas laws give Bastrop's government sway over development.Musk has an estranged transgender daughter and has spoken out against what he calls ""woke mind virus""—which he describes in interviews as divisive identity politics—along with anti-meritocratic and anti-free speech ideas.The developments in Bastrop fit right into the quickening pace of activity across central Texas, where cranes loom above the Austin skyline and the housing market is a perpetual topic of conversation.",Positive

Police algorithm said Lina was at 'medium' risk. Then she was killed Spanish police use an algorithm to assess the risk of repeat domestic violence.

Critics suggest police are abdicating decision-making about women's safety to an algorithm.Lina's case wasn't under her command.VioGén is one element I use to assess that danger, but it's far from the only one element I use to assess that danger, but it's far from the only trigger that led to this woman's murder.""I'm not going to say VioGén doesn't fail,"" she says.Her officers deal with an average of 10 reports of gender violence a day.VioGén classifies nine or 10 women as being ""extreme"" risk of repeat victimization.A 2014 study found that officers accepted VioGén's assessment have an impact on the court's decision to deny her a restraining order against her ex-partner.Lina's children, mother and ex-partner all escaped, but soon the house was on fire.

Scientists claim to have discovered 'new colour' no one has seen before,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clyq0n3em41o,"– A team of scientists claim to have discovered a new color that no human has ever seen before. The research follows an experiment in which researchers in the US had laser pulses fired into their eyes. By stimulating specific cells in the retina, the participants claim to have witnessed a blue-green color that scientists have called ""olo"", but some experts have said the existence of a new color is ""open to argument."" The findings, published in the journal Science Advances on Friday, have been described by the study's co-author, Prof Ren Ng from the University of California, as ""remarkable.""He and his colleagues believe that the results could potentially further research into color blindness.Let's say you go around your whole life and you see only pink, baby pink, a pastel pink.And then one day you go to the office and someone's wearing a shirt, and it's the most intense baby pink you've ever seen, and they say it's a new color and we call it red.""During the team's experiment, researchers shone a laser beam into the pupil of one eye of each participant.There are three types of cone cells in the eye—S, L and M—and each one is sensitive to different wavelengths of blue, red and green respectively.According to the research paper, in normal vision, ""any light that stimulates an M cone cell must also stimulate its neighboring L and/or S cones"", because its function overlaps with them.However, in the study, the laser only stimulated M cones, ""which in principle would send a color signal to the brain that never occurs in natural vision.""Let's say you go around your whole life and you see only pink, baby pink, baby pink, pastel pink, a pastel pink.",Positive
Five dead as huge waves hit Australia coast,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1jx9dknd6go,"– Five people have drowned after huge waves hit parts of Australia at the start of the Easter weekend.Two others are missing off the coasts of New South Wales and Victoria states.On Saturday the body of a man was found in the water near Tathra in southern New South Wales.It came a day after a 58-year-old fisherman and two other men were found dead in separate incidents in the state.Rescuers are searching for a man who was washed into the water near Sydney.
