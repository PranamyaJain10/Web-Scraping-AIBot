Why the US is giving Israel a powerful Thaad anti-missile system The move has been the focus of attention as it involves putting American boots on the ground in Israel.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c39le0dp4p7o,"– The Pentagon has confirmed it is sending a high-altitude anti-missile system operated by US troops to Israel.Officials say the Terminal High-Altitude Area Defense (Thaad) battery will bolster Israeli air defenses after Iran’s missile attack on the country earlier this month.President Joe Biden has said it is meant ""to defend Israel"", which is still expected to retaliate against an Iranian strike involving more than 180 ballistic missiles fired at Israel on 1 October.The move has become the focus of attention as it involves putting American boots on the ground in Israel.There are already a small number of US forces in the country - but this new deployment of about 100 troops is significant as it signals further US entanglement in the expanding regional war.Israel has yet to launch its retaliation for Iran’s attack, which will be ""lethal, precise and above all, surprising"" according to Defense Minister Yoav Gallant.It's still unclear whether the Thaad deployment is part of US contingency planning to bridge gaps identified in Israel’s aerial defenses, or whether it points to growing concerns in Washington of a more forceful Israeli strike on Iran.President Biden has opposed any attack on Iranian nuclear facilities, as well as on its oil or energy infrastructure, amid fears that it would trigger a spiralling conflict and affect the global economy.",Negative
Would Donald Trump’s taxes on trade hurt US consumers? What could happen if Donald Trump drastically increases tariffs as he has promised to do?,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c20myx1erl6o,"– Donald Trump has pledged to drastically increase tariffs on foreign goods entering the US if he is elected president again.He has promised tariffs—a form of tax—of up to 20% on goods from other countries and 60% on all imports from China.Over the course of 2023, the US imported around $3,100bn of goods, equivalent to around 11% of US GDP.And tariffs imposed on those imports brought in $80bn in that year, around 2% of total US tax revenues.The political context for Trump's tariffs was longstanding concern about the loss of US manufacturing jobs to countries with lower labor costs, particularly after the signing of the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta) with Mexico in 1994 and the entry of China into the World Trade Organization in 2001.""Under my plan, American workers will no longer be worried about losing your jobs to foreign nations, instead, foreign nations will be worried about losing their jobs to America,"" he said on the campaign trail.The non-partisan Peterson Institute for International Economics has estimated Trump's new proposed tariffs would lower the incomes of Americans, with the impact ranging from around 4% for the poorest fifth to around 2% for the wealthiest fifth.A typical household in the middle of the US income distribution, the think tank estimates, would lose around $1,700 each year.Various researchers have also warned that another major round of tariffs from the US would risk another spike in domestic inflation.Trump imposed 25% tariffs on imported steel in 2018 to protect US producers.By 2020, total employment in the US steel sector was 80,000, still lower than the 84,000 it had been in 2018.",Negative

Spacecraft blasts off to hunt alien life on a distant moon,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1482xzrge1o,"– A spacecraft that will hunt for signs of alien life on one of Jupiter's icy moons has blasted off from Cape Canaveral, Florida.Nasa launched the spacecraft at 12:06 local time (1606 GMT) after forcing plans last week to postpone.The spacecraft should fly past Europa about 50 times, and each time, it will be blasted with radiation equivalent to one million X-rays.It will both orbit itself further towards Jupiter in what is called the sling-shot effect.It cannot carry enough fuel to motor itself all the way alone, so it will piggyback off the momentum of Earth and Mars' gravitational pull.It will overtake and arrive first.The spacecraft should fly past Europa about 50 times, and each time, it will be blasted with radiation equivalent to one million X-rays.It will imply the possibility of life to the Earth,” says Professor Mark Fox-Powell, a microbiologist at the Open University.“That is hugely significant, because if that happens twice in our solar system, it could mean life is really common,” he says.",Positive
