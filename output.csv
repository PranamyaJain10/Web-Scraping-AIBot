Family members will also join, in a night rumored to include lots of party games. In 2025, I have resolved to have micro-adventures right on my own doorstep, to see those places really close to where you live that you've never got round to seeing. It doesn't take a lot of planning or money, and it doesn't require very much willpower at all!""",Positive

"Police identify woman set on fire in deadly New York City attack Authorities identified Debrina Kawam, 57, of New Jersey as the victim of the 22 December attack.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cr56jlpr2zqo,"– A woman who was set on fire and burned to death last week on a subway train in Brooklyn has been identified as the victim of the seemingly random 22 December attack that burned her body beyond recognition. Sebastian Zapeta, 33, is accused of starting the blaze with a lighter while Ms Kawam was asleep. He allegedly fanned the flames with a shirt and then watched the fire grow from a bench outside the subway car. Police say that Ms Kawam was motionless, apparently asleep, on a stationary subway train at the Coney Island-Stillwell Avenue Station in Brooklyn early on 22 December when Mr Zapeta allegedly approached her with a lighter.Jessica Tisch, New York's police commissioner, said that the smell of smoke drew police officers and Metropolitan Transit Authority personnel to the fire and they extinguished the flames.Eric Gonzalez, the Brooklyn district attorney, said at a press conference early in the investigation that authorities had worked to collect DNA evidence and fingerprints from Ms Kawam's remains.It took authorities more than a week to identify Ms Kawam's body.Jessica Tisch described the incident as ""one of the most depraved crimes one person could possibly commit against another human being.""The suspect, who is originally from Guatemala, was deported from the US in 2018 and later re-entered the country illegally, immigration authorities said.Despite a decline in crime rates on New York City's subway, the incident is one of a string of attacks that has raised concerns for riders on America's largest mass transit system.",Negative
Puerto Rico may enter new year in  darkness after sudden blackout More than a million households were in the dark - the latest in a series of blackouts since Hurricane Maria in 2017.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c8782rvv5xxo,"– Puerto Rico has been plunged into darkness on New Year's Eve by a nearly island-wide blackout.More than 1.2 million out of almost 1.5 million customers have no electricity, said Luma Energy, the island's main power distributor.Fully restoring service could take between 24-48 hours, the company said.The blackout prompted renewed calls to address the unincorporated US territory's power issues, which have persisted since Hurricane Maria in 2017.Hundreds of thousands of residents at a time have been affected by power outages this year.US President Joe Biden has been briefed on the situation and Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm has spoken with Puerto Rico's governor to offer assistance, the White House said.Puerto Rico's power grid was strained even before Hurricane Maria devastated the island.US government funding helped shore up the grid, facilitate recovery projects from other natural disasters, and make other important infrastructure improvements.But the implementation has been incomplete due to a variety of factors, such as issues starting construction and the Federal Emergency Management Agency's requirements to authorise use of some of the funds, according to a February 2024 report from the US Government Accountability Office.Puerto Rico's power grid was strained even before Hurricane Maria devastated the island.",Negative
"FBI finds largest explosive cache on a Virginia farm More than 150 bombs were scattered round the property the suspect shares with his wife and two young children, say investigators.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cp83rp5z0ypo,"– The FBI says it has discovered more than 150 bombs during a raid on a farm in Virginia—thought to be the largest such cache seized by the law-enforcement agency in its history.Brad Spafford was arrested on 17 December in Isle of Wight County, 180 miles south of Washington DC, after a tip-off that he was stockpiling weapons and homemade ammunition on the property he shares with his wife and two young children.Investigators say some of the devices were found in a bedroom in an unsecured backpack labeled ""#nolivesmatter""—an apparent reference to a far-right, anti-government movement.A lawyer for Mr Spafford denied he is a danger to the community and is seeking his client's release from pre-trial detention.Mr Spafford had allegedly used photos of US President Joe Biden for target practice and expressed hope that Vice-President Kamala Harris would be assassinated.Mr Spafford had also said that missing children in the news had been taken by the federal government to be trained as school shooters, according to the court papers.A lawyer for Mr Spafford said on Tuesday that the government's claim he was dangerous was ""rank speculation and fear mongering"", because the suspect had no criminal record.""There is not a shred of evidence in the record that Mr Spafford ever threatened anyone and the contention that someone might be in danger because of their political views and comments is nonsensical,"" the lawyer wrote.",Negative
"Ukraine to end transit of Russian gas to EU Russia will still be able to pipe gas to Hungary, as well as Turkey and Serbia, through the Black Sea.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4glyjx9m71o,"– Russian gas supplies to EU states via Ukraine are to end on Wednesday, when a five-year deal between Ukraine's gas transit operator Naftogaz and Russia's Gazprom expires.The European Commission said the continent's gas system was ""resilient and flexible"" and that it had sufficient capacity to cope with the end of transit via Ukraine.Russia will still be able to send gas to Hungary, as well as Turkey and Serbia, through the TurkStream pipeline across the Black Sea.The EU has significantly reduced imports of gas from Russia since it launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, but a number of eastern member states still depend largely on the supplies, making Russia about 5bn ($5.2bn; £4.2bn a year.) Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky said his country would not allow Russia to ""earn additional billions on our blood"" and had given the EU a year to prepare.The European Commission laid out plans it said would enable EU member states to entirely replace gas transiting through Ukraine.The gas fueled a power plant on which Moldova relies for most of its electricity needs.It also supplied the Russia-backed breakaway region of Transnistria, a small sliver of land sandwiched between Moldova and Ukraine.President Maia Sandu accused the Kremlin of ""blackmail"" possibly aimed at destabilising her country ahead of a general election in 2025.",Negative
Why has the Pitt and Jolie divorce taken eight years? The pair were married for two years - but it has taken four times that time to reach a divorce deal.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvg9dvr408do,"– It's been eight years since Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt were married for two years—but it has taken four times as long as the marriage itself to settle?One part of the answer is that it's a particularly messy divorce, complicated by bitter legal disputes involving their children and a French vineyard they bought together.Celebrity lawyer Chris Melcher told BBC News the divorce settlement had taken an unusually long time.""This is much longer than any divorce we typically see,"" he said.""But they initially had fights over custody and then it revolved around this winery they own together, and that's been the focus of their fight over the last few years.""Many celebrities want to divorce quickly and move on, Melcher explained.""A lot of times in a case of this magnitude we can settle it within six months, a year at the very most. Eight years is really a sign of something more going on.""It's an inability to let go and a desire to really harm the other.""Kate Daly, co-founder of online divorce company Amicable, told the BBC that such a case was very different from an average divorce.""It's an industry... [they can afford] lots of expensive lawyers.Regarding the divorce, Pitt said he and Jolie had decided to abandon a path of ""vitriolic hatred"" and work together to sort out their issues, adding that they were committed to resolving matters amicably and privately.In 2019, a judge declared that the couple were officially single, but that the divorce still needed to be finalized.",Negative

Blurred battle lines: How the wars of 2024 brought together rivals - but created new enemies,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cm2ewemgjw1o,"– It's a complex and confusing web of conflicts and it prompts the inevitable question: Are the world's battle lines becoming ever more interconnected?""Let's get one thing straight: this is not World War Three, although President Putin does like to dangle that menace to scare the West away from sending more powerful weapons to Ukraine.But first, an important caveat. Contrary to the impression we often get via the world's media, most of the Middle East is not at war.One of the many effects of the Hamas-led raid into southern Israel is that the Israeli government's response has had a devastating effect on Iran's allies in the region.A massive one-way pipeline of US, Nato and EU assistance, both financial and military, has enabled Ukraine to largely hold off the Russian army—until now.Voicing a complaint shared by many Ukrainians, he adds: ""Yes, our Western allies help us with some weapons and training, and we are very grateful for that, but the scale of it is incomparable next to the military assistance Russia gets from Iran and North Korea.It must be the other way round if you'd really like to see us—and Europe—win.""",Positive
