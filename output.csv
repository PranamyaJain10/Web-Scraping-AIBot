Putin warns West as Russia hits Ukraine with new missile Russia's president says the attack on Dnipro is a response to Ukraine's use of long-range US and UK weaponry.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy4n9vgwnnyo,"– Russian President Vladimir Putin has said that an attack by his forces on the eastern Ukrainian city of Dnipro on Thursday morning was carried out using ""a new conventional intermediate-range missile.""He said that the missile, codenamed Oreshnik, was a response to the use by Ukraine of US and UK long-range weaponry to hit targets inside Russia.Putin added that Russia could attack military facilities of those countries which allowed their weapons to be used for this purpose.The US and the UK authorized the use of US ATACMS and UK-supplied Storm Shadow missiles this week, in a major change of policy. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Russia's use of the new missile was ""a clear and severe escalation in the scale and brutality of this war.""""[This] is yet more proof that Russia has no interest in peace,"" he wrote on X, adding: ""Putin is not only prolonging the war - he is spitting in the face of those in the world who genuinely want peace to be restored."" Earlier, Zelensky said the missile had the characteristics of an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM), even as Western officials cast doubt on this theory.The US National Security Council, meanwhile, said ""an experimental medium-range ballistic missile"" had been used against Ukraine, adding that Russia probably only possessed a handful of these weapons and that they would not be a game changer in the war.",Negative
"'I am safe': US kayaker who faked death sends video to police Police say Ryan Borgwardt is believed to be in Eastern Europe, and has sent a video to prove he is safe.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cd7nw8wxz13o,"– A US man who faked his own death and fled the country, leaving behind his family, has been in contact with police in his home state and sent investigators a video to prove that he is safe. Ryan Borgwardt, 45, vanished on 12 August while on a solo fishing trip, the Green Lake County Sheriff's Office in Wisconsin said in a news conference on Thursday. Police initially suspected that he had drowned and searched the lake for 54 days before finding digital evidence that led them to suspect he had fled to Eastern Europe. ""The great news is he's still alive and well,"" said Green Lake County Sheriff Mark Podell. ""The bad news is that we don't know where exactly Ryan is, and he has not decided to return home."" The 24-second video is shot selfie-style, and shows Mr Borgwardt in an apartment with white walls. ""Good evening, it's Ryan Borgwardt,"" he says. ""Today is 11 November. It's approximately 10 am by you guys. I'm in my apartment. ""I am safe, secure, no problem. I hope this works."" Police have been emailing him, ""pulling at his heartstrings"" in an effort to coax him back home and ""clean up the mess that he has created."" Podoll said that there are currently no criminal charges pending against Mr Borgwardt, but that police say he owes them $40,000 (£32,000) for the cost of their search.",Negative
Fake-alcohol deaths highlight SE Asia's methanol problem The deaths of five tourists after apparently drinking tainted drinks highlight the wider issue of bootleg alcohol.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cde7j9j76x0o,"– A British woman, an Australian woman, a US man and two Danish nationals have died, while another Australian woman remains critically ill in hospital.The deaths remain under police investigation, but news reports and testimonies online from other tourists suggest they may have consumed drinks laced with methanol, a deadly substance often found in bootleg alcohol.Methanol poisoning has long been a well-known issue across South-East Asia, particularly in the poorer countries along the Mekong river.But despite foreign governments posting warnings about alcohol consumption in these places, there is still little awareness among the backpacker party scene.In countries like Laos - one of the poorest and least developed in Asia - the problem arises from alcohol suppliers exploiting an environment where there is low law enforcement and almost no regulations in the food and hospitality industries.You have the unscrupulous producer adding methanol to their drinks because it’s cheaper—it’s used to create a stronger-seeming drink or make lower-quality alcohol drinks seem more potent.""I don't think it's nefarious bar owners going out of their way to poison tourists—that's not good for them or their industry either,"" the diplomat told the BBC.Methanol poisoning has long been a well-known issue across South-East Asia, particularly in the poorer countries along the Mekong river.But despite foreign governments posting warnings about alcohol consumption in these places, there is still little awareness among the backpacker party scene.In countries like Laos - one of the poorest and least developed in Asia - the problem arises from alcohol suppliers exploiting an environment where there is low law enforcement and almost no regulations in the food and hospitality industries.This horrific event will probably help educate people, but not solve the cause of the problem.",Negative
"Illinois Supreme Court overturns Jussie Smollett conviction for alleged hoax Smollett, who is black and gay, was accused of lying about being the victim of a racial attack in Chicago.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c8xp28eq5l9o,"– ""What would be more unjust than the resolution of any one criminal case would be a holding from this court that the State was not bound to honor agreements upon which people have detrimentally relied."" During Smollett's trial, prosecutors alleged he staged the attack because he was unhappy with a television studio's response to hate mail he received. Smollett said the attack was ""no hoax"" and that he was the victim of a hate crime in Chicago.But the two men he accused of perpetrating the crime - two brothers, one of whom Smollett said he met through the Empire show - said Smollett hired them and paid them with a cheque.The state Supreme Court sided with Smollett's attorneys, who argued in their appeal that Smollett should not have been charged by a special prosecutor after the Cook County State Attorney's Office dropped charges in exchange for community service.A grand jury later re-established the charges after a special prosecutor took on the case.The decision sparked an uproar from many, including Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel said who said Smollett was ""let off scot-free, with no sense of accountability for the moral and ethical wrong of his actions.""",Negative
Ukraine's double challenge: Russia's advance and the return of Trump Russia is advancing at its fastest pace since 2022. Will Trump help or hinder Ukraine's defence?,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c36pypjdneyo,"– ""God only knows,"" she sighs. ""We were bombed so much and so many people died there."" Russia launched an enormous ballistic missile strike on Dnipro overnight too. It was felt across the city and sent everyone including the BBC team to bomb shelters.The Biden administration's latest decisions on Atacms and land mines are clearly designed to help Ukraine hold on to territory, both its own and in the Kursk region of Russia.Both could feature in negotiations next year, if that's the path Donald Trump intends to pursue.So far, the US president-elect has given very few clues as to how he intends to end the conflict, beyond a typically vainglorious promise to end the war in 24 hours.Ukrainian politicians, from President Zelensky on down, seem keen to give Trump the benefit of the doubt.'I think he has taken a very smart approach,"" former foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba told me, 'by clearly setting out the goal—'I'm going to fix it'—but without getting into details.'",Positive
"Russia gives North Korea a million barrels of oil, report finds Satellite image analysis shows several North Korean tankers visiting Russia dozens of times since March.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cjr4pr0gyyzo,"– Russia is estimated to have supplied North Korea with more than a million barrels of oil since March this year, according to satellite imagery analysis from the Open Source Centre, a non-profit research group based in the UK.The oil is payment for the weapons and troops Pyongyang has sent Moscow to fuel its war in Ukraine, leading experts and UK Foreign Secretary, David Lammy, have told the BBC.These transfers violate UN sanctions, which ban countries from selling oil to North Korea, except in small quantities, in an attempt to stifle its economy to prevent it from further developing nuclear weapons.The satellite images, shared exclusively with the BBC, show more than a dozen different North Korean oil tankers arriving at an oil terminal in Russia's Far East a total of 43 times over the past eight months.This steady flow of oil gives North Korea a level of stability it hasn't had since these sanctions were introduced.Four former members of a UN panel responsible for tracking the sanctions on North Korea have told the BBC the transfers are a consequence of increasing ties between Moscow and Pyongyang.North Korea is the only country in the world not allowed to buy oil on the open market.The number of barrels of refined petroleum it can receive is capped by the United Nations at 500,000 annually, well below the amount it needs.Russia's foreign ministry did not respond to our request for comment.",Negative
"Arrest warrants issued for Netanyahu, Gallant and Hamas commander over alleged war crimes Judges accuse them over alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity related to Israel's war with Hamas.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cly2exvx944o,"– The International Criminal Court has issued arrest warrants for Israel's prime minister and former defense minister, as well as the military commander of Hamas.A statement said a pre-trial chamber had rejected Israel's challenges to the court's jurisdiction and issued warrants for Benjamin Netanyahu and Yoav Gallant.A warrant was also issued for Mohammed Deif of Hamas, although Israel has said he was killed in an air strike in Gaza in July.The judges said there were ""reasonable grounds"" the three men bore ""criminal responsibility"" for alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity during the war between Israel and Hamas. Prime Minister Netanyahu condemned the ICC's decision as ""antisemitic,"" while Hamas said the warrants for Netanyahu and Gallant had set an ""important historical precedent.""The impact of these warrants will in part depend on whether the ICC's 124 member states—which do not include Israel or its main ally, the United States— decide to enforce them or not.The White House said the US rejected the ICC decision. However, several European countries have said they respect the decisions of the court.Israel rejects the ICC's jurisdiction, but the court ruled in 2021 that it had jurisdiction over the occupied West Bank, East Jerusalem and Gaza because the UN's secretary general had accepted the Palestinians were a member.",Negative

Trudeau plays Santa with seasonal tax break,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/czr7xyjy0kmo,"– Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is playing Father Christmas with a seasonally-timed tax break amid growing frustrations about Canada's cost of living.The prime minister announced Thursday a two-month limited-time break on sales tax on a set list of goods during the holiday season.The list includes Christmas trees, restaurant meals, toys, alcohol and sweets, among other things.Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre—who will face off against the Liberal prime minister in a looming election—called Trudeau's tax measures ""a trick"" aimed at deflecting attention from the government's role in rising costs. Trudeau's limited tax relief, if approved by parliament, would run from 15 December to 15 February.It would remove the federal sales tax known as GST—or the harmonised sales tax (HST) in provinces that combine federal and provincial sales taxes into one tax—from a select list of items.Those items include: Children's clothingChildren's footwearChildren's diapersChildren' car seatsNewspapers BooksChristmas treesFood and beverages that are normally not tax-exempt, such as prepared foods, sweets, alcohol and sodasChildren's toys for under-14sVideo-game consoles The government estimated that the relief will save Canadians C$100-$260 (£56.86-£147.82) if they spend C$2,000 (£1,137.10 over this time period.)",Positive
