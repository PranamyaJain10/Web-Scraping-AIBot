Canada follows France and UK with plan to recognise Palestinian state Mark Carney says the move depends on Palestinian democratic reforms and elections without Hamas.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ceqyx35d9x2o,"– Most countries - 147 of the UN's 193 member states - formally recognize a Palestinian state. Most countries - 147 of the UN's 193 member states - formally recognize a Palestinian state. Carney said Canada would formally recognize the state of Palestine at the upcoming UN General Assembly. He cited the expansion of Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank, the worsening humanitarian situation in Gaza, and the 7 October 2023 attacks on Israel by Hamas as reasons behind Canada's dramatic shift in foreign policy.""The level of human suffering in Gaza is intolerable and it is rapidly deteriorating,"" Carney told reporters on Wednesday.Asked whether he was influenced by the UK and France's announcements, or whether he had consulted US President Donald Trump, Carney responded that Canada made its own foreign policy decisions.If France and the UK do formally recognize Palestinian statehood, the US - a strong ally of Israel - will be the only permanent member of the UN Security Council not to do so.The Israeli military launched a campaign in Gaza in response to the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage.Canada had long been committed to a two-state solution as part of a negotiated peace process, Carney said, but he added ""this approach is no longer tenable"".""The prospect of a Palestinian state is being eroded before our eyes,"" he said.",Negative
"US allies break with Trump to force diplomatic shift on Gaza As Canada joins France and the UK with plans to recognise a Palestinian state, the US stands firmly with Israel - but does Trump have a long-term plan for Gaza's future?",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cly6rl6158no,"– The US is standing firmly with Israel—but does Trump have a long-term plan for Gaza's future?Of all history's declarations about the Middle East, one that may be less prominent in the global collective memory was in Tokyo in November 2023.Then-US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken laid out a series of principles for the ""day after"" the war in Gaza at a meeting of the G7 a group of the world's most powerful countries.He traveled there from Tel Aviv, after meeting Israel's leadership a month after the Hamas attacks on October 7, during the ensuing Israeli offensive on Gaza.Blinken listed what amounted to US conditions for Israel's military objectives and the wider conflict: No forcible displacement of Palestinians.No Israeli re-occupation of Gaza after the war ends.No attempt to blockade or besiege Gaza.It amounts to a growing evidence that the Trump administration's strategy on Gaza increasingly parallels that of its Israeli ally.In February, President Trump declared that the US would take over the Gaza Strip and build a ""riviera of the Middle East"" in a plan that involved the forced displacement of Palestinians in the territory, which the US and Israel later tried to claim meant ""voluntary"" emigration.Asked on Tuesday about his plan to move Palestinians Trump described it as ""a concept that was really embraced by a lot of people, but also some people didn't like it.""The administration prefers to talk about the immediate issue: freeing hostages and getting a ceasefire.",Negative
What screen time does to children's brains is more complicated than it seems Screen time has become synonymous with bad news - but the science may not be as straightforward as it seems,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c9d0l40v551o,"– A renowned neuroscientist Baroness Susan Greenfield went as far as to say that prolonged screen time to the early days of climate change: a significant shift that people weren't taking seriously now.But warnings about the dark side might not tell the full story.An editorial in the British Medical Journal argued that Baroness Greenfield's claims around the brain were ""not based on a fair scientific appraisal of the evidence... and are misleading to parents and the public at large.""So have we got it wrong when it comes to worrying about our children and curbing their access to tech too? Pete Etchells, a psychology professor at Bath Spa University, is one of the academics in the group arguing that the evidence is lacking.In his book: The Real Science of Screen Time, he argues that the science behind the headline-grabbing conclusions is a mixed bag and, in many cases, flawed.An editorial in the British Medical Journal argued that Baroness Greenfield's claims around the brain were ""not based on a fair scientific appraisal of the evidence... and are misleading to parents and the public at large.""",Negative
Why Australians celebrate Christmas twice a year The Australian tradition was born in the 1980s after a group of Irishmen became homesick for a winter Christmas.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/crevj4nn34yo,"– It's hard to pinpoint exactly when and where Christmas in July began—there are some rumors the US actually pioneered it in the early 20th Century—but Garry Crockett believes Australia's national tradition began in his Mountain Heritage hotel in 1980.One cold July evening, with snow falling outside, half a dozen Irishmen walked into the Katoomba huts, nostalgic for a traditional winter Christmas.""So I told them, why don't we do a Christmas in July for you?"" Mr Crockett, now 76, tells the BBC.A Christmas tree was off, tinsel and baubles were unpacked, and the hotel was decked out with decorations.While this month is mid-summer for half the world, Australia is in the depths of winter and for many, that means it's time for tinsel, turkey, and Yuletide tunes.From then on, Christmas in July became an annual gathering at the Mountain Heritage.It's hard to pinpoint exactly when and where Christmas in July began—there are some rumors the US actually pioneered it in the early 20th Century—but Garry Crockett believes Australia's national tradition began in his Mountain Heritage hotel in 1980.One cold July evening, with snow falling outside, half a dozen Irishmen walked into the Katoomba huts, nostalgic for a traditional winter Christmas.""So I told them, why don't we do a Christmas in July for you?""

"Why did Russian mega earthquake not cause more tsunami damage? The earthquake was one of the strongest ever recorded, but its tsunami was not as bad as feared.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0l6pj7kjg7o,"– It has been one of the strongest earthquakes ever recorded—but so far has not brought the catastrophic tsunami that many feared.When the 8.8-magnitude quake struck eastern Russia at 11:25 local time on Wednesday (00:25 BST), it raised concerns for coastal populations across the Pacific.Millions of people were evacuated, as minds cast back to the devastating tsunami of Boxing Day 2004 in the Indian Ocean and Japan 2011, both triggered by similarly large earthquakes.But today's tsunami has been much less severe, even though it's brought some damage.So what caused the earthquake and tsunami—and why wasn't it as bad as initially feared? The Kamchatka Peninsula is remote but lies in the ""Pacific Ring of Fire""—so called because of the high number of earthquakes and volcanoes that occur here.The upper layers of the Earth are split into sections— tectonic plates—which are all moving relative to one another.The ""Pacific Ring of Fire"" is an arc of these plates that extends around the Pacific.The largest earthquakes recorded in history, including the three strongest in Chile, Alaska and Sumatra, were all megathrust earthquakes.The Pacific plate is oceanic, which means it has dense rocks and wants to sink beneath the less dense microplate.As the Pacific plate sinks towards the center of the Earth, it heats up and begins to melt, effectively disappearing.""When we typically think about earthquakes, we imagine an epicentre as a small point on a map.However, for such large earthquakes, the fault will have ruptured over many hundreds of kilometers,"" explained Dr Stephen Hicks, lecturer in environmental seismology at University College London.""It is this vast amount of slip and area of the fault that generates such a high earthquake magnitude.""The largest earthquakes recorded in history, including the three strongest in Chile, Alaska and Sumatra, both triggered by similarly large earthquakes.",Negative
"Trump sanctions judge in Bolsonaro coup case and hits Brazil with 50% tariffs The US also imposed a 50% tariff on Brazil after Trump accused it of ""attacks"" on US companies and of conducting a ""witch hunt"" against Bolsonaro.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/crlzn72eg25o,"– US officials said on Wednesday that they will sanction Brazilian Supreme Court judge Alexandre de Moraes, accusing him of authorising ""arbitrary pre-trial detentions"" and suppressing ""freedom of expression.""Judge Moraes has been leading the investigation into allegations that Brazil's former right-wing President Jair Bolsonaro and his allies plotted a coup after he lost the 2022 election.Bolsonaro has denied those allegations and has called Judge Moraes a ""dictator.""Shortly after the sanctions were announced, US President Donald Trump signed an executive order that raised tariffs on Brazil to 50%. Trump had threatened to impose the steep tariffs earlier this month in a letter he shared on social media to Brazil's current president Luiz Incio Lula da Silva.The executive order on tariffs excludes several of Brazil's major exports from the steep taxes, including orange juice, some aircraft parts and energy products.The order also ties the tariffs directly to Brazil's ""politically motivated persecution, intimidation, harassment, censorship and prosecution"" of Bolsonaro.Judge Moraes has imposed a raft of pre-trial restrictions on Bolsonaro, including a night-time and weekend curfew and 24-hour surveillance to prevent him from fleeing the country.The country had also briefly banned Elon Musk's X, formerly known as Twitter, after the platform refused to shut down accounts that were deemed by Brazil to be spreading misinformation about the 2022 Brazilian presidential election.",Negative
Warning issued after US energy drink cans accidentally filled with vodka The warnings impact certain varieties of High Noon vodka seltzers and Celsius energy drink cans.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4g0z1d28e5o,"– US authorities are warning consumers of Celsius energy drinks to check their cans after some were accidentally filled with vodka. The US Food & Drug Administration issued the warning for the Astro Vibe Blue Razz edition of the drink.The mix-up came about after a packaging supplier mistakenly shipped empty Celsius cans to the vodka seltzer company High Noon, which filled them with alcohol.High Noon is also recalling some of its Beach Variety packs which came from the same production line.The recall affects two production lots, which the USFDA published on its website.The products were shipped to retailers in Florida, New York, Ohio, South Carolina, Virginia and Wisconsin, between 21 July and 23 July.Consumers are advised to dispose of the Celsius Astro Vibe energy drink, Sparkling Blue Razz Edition cans with the impacted lot codes, and not consume the liquid"" the USFDA said.",Negative
"'Communities' of strange, extreme life seen for first time in deep ocean",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3wnqe5j99do,"– The deepest marine life filmed before this expedition was at 8,336m—a snailfish that was filmed swimming in a deep ocean trench off the coast of Japan in 2023.These new observations are published in the journal Nature.Although it was accepted among marine scientists that there would be life at these depths, scientists on this mission say the abundance of animals they saw from the windows of their submersible was ""amazing.""Diving in a human-occupied submersible to ocean trenches in the northwest Pacific Ocean, a Chinese-led research team captured pictures of life at depths of more than 9km (5.6 miles).The deepest marine life filmed before this expedition was at 8,336m—a snailfish that was filmed swimming in a deep ocean trench off the coast of Japan in 2023.The team, led by researchers from the Chinese Academy of Sciences' Institute of Deep Sea Science and Engineering, discovered what they describe as ""thriving communities"" of creatures.It's exciting—especially for a deep sea scientist—to go to a place that human beings have not explored,"" one of the lead researchers, Dr Xiaotong Peng, told BBC News.Scientists photographed and filmed what looked like fields of marine life—dominated by various different types of tube worm and mollusc.With no sunlight, life at these depths is fueled by chemicals that seep out of the ocean floor. Hydrogen sulfide and methane seep out of faults—or cracks—in the Earth's crust.The scientists say they have recorded species never seen before.",Positive
"New York City gunman bought rifle from casino supervisor, police say",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cgerj43qdq7o,"– The gunman who opened fire in a New York City skyscraper, killing four people, purchased the rifle used in the attack from his boss at a Las Vegas casino, investigators said.The supervisor, who has not been named, is co-operating with officials, and has not been charged. Shane Tamura, 27, died by suicide and left a note claiming to be suffering from CTE, a brain disease triggered by head injuries, police said.The attack took the lives of policeman Didarul Islam, executive Wesley LePatner, security guard Aland Etienne, and real estate worker Julia Hyman. Police said on Wednesday the semi-automatic rifle—also known as an assault rifle—was sold by the Horseshoe casino supervisor for $1,400 (£1,100). Tamura worked for the surveillance team at the casino.In Nevada, any adult over 18 can buy a gun without a permit, however all sales require purchasers to undergo a background check. Officials did not say whether the check had been performed before the private sale of the rifle.The supervisor also sold Tamura the black BMW that he drove from Las Vegas to New York, investigators revealed.A search of the gunman's Las Vegas studio apartment uncovered anti-psychotic medication, and a suicide note addressed to his parents, they added.Officers are speaking to his co-workers, and his parents are also co-operating with investigators.",Negative
