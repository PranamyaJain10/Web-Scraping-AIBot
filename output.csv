You are now a citizen of the United States of America.

Are planes crashing more often? A recent flurry of air disasters have made some people worried about flying - but are crashes on the rise?,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5ym8n4lzp6o,"– After a series of high-profile accidents, some social media users suggested that air travel accidents were becoming more frequent.Videos of hair-raising near misses began to trend online and the US Transport Secretary Sean Duffy sought to calm fears in an interview with the BBC's US partner, CBS News.But BBC Verify has analysed data in the US and worldwide and found that over the past two decades there has been a general downward trend in air accidents.This data shows a general fall in air accidents in the US from 2005 to 2024 despite a significant increase in the overall number of flights over this period.Ismo Aaltonen, formerly Finland's chief air disaster investigator, told BBC Verify they are not an indication of a decline in aircraft safety.He noted that some incidents over the past few months were unforeseeable, citing an Azerbaijan Airlines flight which crashed in Kazakhstan in December after being targeted by a Russian anti-aircraft missile.Marco Chan, a former pilot and senior lecturer at New University, told BBC Verify that the rise in awareness of air disasters is being further fuelled because ""accidents are getting increasing exposure from social media platforms.""One video circulating on TikTok - which has been pulled from a Superman film - shows the hero preventing a jet from smashing into a stadium.The viral clip suggests that aviation disasters have grown since the ex-US transportation secretary left office in January.",Negative

"Document work or resign, Doge tells US federal workers in email The email comes as Elon Musk leads an effort to aggressively curtail the government workforce.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cr72n1yyj30o,"– Federal workers received an email on Saturday afternoon asking them to list their accomplishments from the past week or resign—the latest development in the Trump administration's efforts targeting the federal workforce.The emails came after billionaire and Trump confidante Elon Musk tweeted that workers would ""shortly receive an email requesting to understand what they got done last week.""Once again, Elon Musk and the Trump Administration have shown their utter disdain for federal employees and the critical services they provide to the American people,"" Everett Kelley, union president, said in a statement.Earlier in the day, Trump touted cuts and told a crowd of supporters at Cpac that the work of federal employees was inadequate because they did not come into the office.The Department of Government Efficiency (Doge) is not an official government department, but Musk's team has exacted wide-ranging changes to the US federal infrastructure with approval from the White House.Thousands of government employees at the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), the Pentagon, and the Federal Aviation Administration, as well as other agencies, have been fired in recent weeks.The email mirrors Musk's handling of employees after he acquired social media platform Twitter in 2022.Musk has been leading an outside effort to aggressively curtail government spending through funding cuts and firings.",Negative
"US measles outbreak sickens nearly 100 in Texas, New Mexico Texas authorities reported a surge in cases since January in communities with low vaccination rates.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cq8yvg5359po,"– Health officials in Texas say those numbers are likely an undercount, as some parents may not report infections or may not realize their child has the disease.""It is troubling, because this was completely preventable,"" Dr. Amesh Adalja, an infectious disease physician and senior scholar at Johns Hopkins University, told CBS News, the BBC's American news partner.""It's the most contagious infectious disease known to humans,"" she added.Texas officials reported that of the 90 cases in their state, 85 were in people who are unvaccinated or whose vaccination status is unclear.Most states require that children receive the MMR vaccine to attend school, but many, including Texas, also allow families to file a conscientious exemption—a non-medical reason to refuse a vaccine requirement.Measles infection can have particularly devastating complications for pregnant women and young children, including pneumonia, neurological impairment, hearing loss and death, and survivors are at risk of developing a degenerative brain and nervous system disease known as subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE).Health experts say that the disease could be controlled or even eradicated with proper inoculation rates—generally defined as 95% of a community receiving the measles vaccine.",Negative
The asteroid hits and near-misses you never hear about,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5y494xkp3yo,"– A large asteroid known as 2024 YR4 has grabbed headlines this week as scientists first raised its chances of hitting Earth, then lowered them.The latest estimate says the object has a 0.28% chance of hitting Earth in 2032, significantly lower than the 3.1% chance earlier in the week.But in the time since 2024 YR4 was first spotted through a telescope in the desert in Chile two months ago, tens of other objects have passed closer to Earth than the Moon, which in astronomical terms sounds like a near miss.It is likely that others, albeit much smaller, have hit us or burned up in the atmosphere but gone unnoticed.This is the story of the asteroids that you never hear about—the fly-bys, the near-misses and the direct hits.The most serious near-miss, and the closest comparison with YR4, was an asteroid called Apophis which was first spotted in 2004 and measured 375 meters across, or around the size of a cruise ship.Professor Patrick Michel from French National Center for Scientific Research (CNRS) tracked Apophis and recalls it was considered the most hazardous asteroid ever detected.It took until 2013 to get enough observations to understand that it was not going to hit Earth.But since Apophis, there have been huge advances in what is called planetary defense.Prof Michel is part of the international Space Mission Planning Advisory Group.Its delegates advise governments on how to respond to an asteroid threat and run rehearsal exercise for direct hits.",Negative
Invisible Losses: Tens of thousands fighting for Russia are dying unnoticed on the frontline in Ukraine,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cgkm7lly61do,"– Over 95,000 people fighting for Russia's military have now died as the war in Ukraine enters the fourth year, according to data analysed by the BBC.This figure doesn't include those who were killed serving in the militia of the self-proclaimed Donbass which we estimate to be between 21,000 and 23,500 fighters.The list includes names of the deceased that we verified using information from official reports, newspapers, social media, and new memorials and graves.The real death toll is believed to be much higher.The Kremlin seems to have designed it this way, ensuring that the most privileged sections of society remain largely disconnected from the war.Only 30% of Russians have had direct exposure to the war, either by fighting in it or family connections to combatants, according to a public opinion poll from the Chronicles project in September 2024.The real death toll is believed to be much higher.",Negative
