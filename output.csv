Zelensky suggests 'hot phase' of war could end if unoccupied Ukraine comes under Nato But Zelensky points out no-one has yet made such an offer and whether Nato would consider a move is doubtful.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn8g8ylvyldo,"– President Volodymyr Zelensky has suggested that the parts of Ukraine under his control should be taken ""under the NATO umbrella"" to try and stop the ""hot phase"" of the war.Zelensky said he would, but only if Nato membership was offered to the whole of Ukraine, within its internationally recognized borders, first.Ukraine could then attempt to negotiate the return of territory currently under Russian control ""in a diplomatic way"", he said.But the suggestion is highly theoretical. Zelensky pointed out, no one has yet made such an offer.Whether NATO would ever consider such a move is highly doubtful.The Ukrainian president has already said that he thinks the war could end in the coming year if Ukraine's allies show sufficient resolve.Reports suggest that discussion of the so-called West German model (Nato membership offered to a divided country) has been going on in Western circles for more than a year.But no formal proposals have yet been made.It is also worth noting that so far Russia's President Vladimir Putin has given absolutely no indication that he's abandoned his desire to subjugate Ukraine entirely.The idea that he would be willing to allow any part of Ukraine to join NATO is, for now, unthinkable.",Negative
"Major Canadian news outlets sue OpenAI The suit, a first for Canada, alleges OpenAI's chatbot was illegally scraping news articles, which the firm denies.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cm27247j6gno,"– A coalition of Canada's biggest news outlets is suing OpenAI, the maker of artificial intelligence chatbot ChatGPT, alleging the company is illegally using news articles to train its software.News organizations including the Toronto Star, Metroland Media, Postmedia, The Globe and Mail, the Canadian Press, and CBC have all joined the suit, reportedly the first of its kind in the country.“Journalism is in the public interest.

While the lawsuit against OpenAI is a first for Canadian publishers, it follows a similar action in the US launched by the New York Times and other publishers last year.",Positive

Canada town council gets alternative after refusal to take King's oath,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cm272nglelqo,"– A Canadian territory has changed its rules for elected municipal officials, allowing them to take an oath pledging allegiance to the country's constitution instead of the British Crown when they are sworn in.The change comes after the newly-elected council of Dawson City, Yukon, refused to take the King's oath in solidarity with an indigenous council member who raised concerns about the Crown's history in Canada.The protest delayed their confirmation and placed the town's governance at a standstill.Under Yukon law, a newly- elected official must take it within 40 days of their election or else their win ""shall be considered null."" Darwyn Lynn, a member of the Trondk Hwchin First Nation, said he was hesitant to take an oath because of Canada's fraught history with indigenous peoples.“I read it probably about 15 times, and it didn’t get any easier to do,” said Lynn at the press conference announcing the change.“With the history that the Crown has had in Canada and other places, I thought that there may be another option.”By questioning the requirement, a “wonderful conversation” on Canada’s history was sparked in Dawson City, a town of 2,400 people, as well as in the broader Yukon territory, he said.",Positive
"Gargoyles, stained glass and the spire: How Notre-Dame was restored",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0qdj80py3no,"– Paris' Notre-Dame cathedral live on TV, giving the public a first look inside the building since much of it was destroyed or damaged in a huge fire in 2019. It is not just a renovation after the fire, but a complete overhaul including removing decades of crud and soot built up since the last restoration. Here we take a look at some of the key features of the repair work and how it was achieved: The collapse of the spire was the climax of the 2019 fire. Many people thought it was medieval, but in fact the original was taken down in the 1790s because it was deemed dangerous. The vast majority of the masonry was undamaged, but it was covered not just in age-old accretions of dust and dirt from the past, but also in a layer of soot and lead powder from the fire. To rebuild the vaulted ceiling beneath where the spire had stood, masons had to relearn the principles of Gothic architecture—using a wooden frame to put the stones in place and crowning it all with the keystone. Many of the exterior sculptures—including the famous (but not medieval) gargoyles and chimaeras—were damaged by high-pressure hoses used to fight the fire.",Negative
