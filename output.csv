Magnets were used for removing metal from wounds as far back as the Crimean War in the 1850s.But Oleh's team modernized the approach, creating flexible models for abdominal surgery, micro-extractors for delicate work, and high-strength tools for bones.In just one year, Doctor Maksymenko's team has performed over 70 successful heart operations with the device, which has changed the face of front-line medicine in Ukraine.The development of these extractors came after front-line medics highlighted the urgent need for a safe, fast, minimally invasive way to remove shrapnel.The Ukrainian Health Ministry says medical devices must comply fully comply with technical regulations.However, in exceptional cases, such as martial law or a state of emergency, the use of uncertified devices is allowed to meet the needs of the military and security forces.At the height of war, there's no time for red tape, mastermind Oleh explains.",Positive
"Trump visits 'Alligator Alcatraz', the next step in his immigration crackdown Administration officials say the new facility will speed up deportations, but local politicians and environmental groups have raised concerns.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cm2zzdmrd9qo,"– ""We're surrounded by miles of treacherous swampland and the only way out is, really, deportation,"" Trump said on the tour, adding that he ""wouldn't want to run through the Everglades for long"" and that anyone who attempted to do so would be met by ""a lot of cops in the form of alligators."" Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis said that he intends to deputise members of the state's National Guard Judge Advocate Corps, or Jags, to act as immigration judges and facilitate rapid removals from the country. Trump said the facility ""could be"" a model for future such facilities, adding that his administration is actively working with the governments of several Republican-run states, such as Louisiana, to find other suitable locations.The facility is designed to hold 3,000 detainees, with the first expected to arrive as soon as Wednesday.It will be situated on the Dade-Collier Training and Transition Airport, a public airport around 36 miles from Miami, and an area deemed an important subtropical wetland.Experts warn the damage to area wetlands and endangered species could undo the state's massive effort to restore the Everglades, which has cost Florida billions of dollars. Local residents who live near the site, like Betty Osceola, a member of the Miccosukee Native American community, have told the BBC they are worried that the temporary facility will become permanent.It will cost about $450m (£332m) a year to run and funding will mostly come from a temporary shelter and services program that the Federal Emergency Management Agency had used for undocumented immigrants, according to Noem.",Negative

An earlier version was cleared by House Republicans by a single-vote margin.Trump had given the Republican-controlled Congress a deadline of 4 July to send him a final version of the bill to sign into law.Despite efforts to galvanise the party, Senate Majority Leader John Thune lost three Republicans—Maine's Susan Collins, North Carolina's Thom Tillis and Kentucky's Rand Paul—in the narrow vote.The legislation, considered a cornerstone of Trump's second-term agenda, would make permanent large tax cuts that were temporarily put in place when he was first in office.Murkowski still appeared discontented with the bill, describing the process as ""rushed"" and under an ""artificial whirlwind timeline.""I struggled with the impact on the most vulnerable in this country"", Murkowski said, adding the process was ""probably the most difficult and agonising legislative 24-hour period"" of her career.",Negative
