In an NBC News interview, the US president said he was angry with Putin for attacking Ukrainian President Volodymyrensky's credibility, and threatened to impose a 50% tariff on countries buying Russian oil if he did not agree to a ceasefire.""If Russia and I are unable to make a deal on stopping the bloodshed in Ukraine, and if I think it was Russia's fault - which it might not be... I am going to put secondary tariffs... on all oil coming out of Russia,"" he said.The comments mark a shift in Trump's tone toward Putin and Russia. European leaders had worried that Trump was cozying up to Putin as negotiations on a ceasefire in Ukraine continued.Over the past six weeks, Trump has harangued Zelensky in the Oval Office and demanded numerous concessions from Ukraine's president.This appears to be a departure from that dynamic.",Negative

"Canadian Conservative faces backlash after trying to sweet talk Trump Alberta premier Danielle Smith has been welcomed by Trump-friendly Republican circles, sparking controversy in Canada.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0jgx10z8qqo,"– Alberta Premier Danielle Smith says she is willing to walk into the ""lion's den"" to sway US officials against Canadian tariffs—wooing the US president with meetings at Mar-a-Lago and cosying up with Trump-friendly media.While many of Canada's leaders—from Prime Minister Mark Carney to Ontario's Premier Doug Ford—are talking tough on Donald Trump, Smith has been taking a notably softer approach.But this tack has led to controversy—not only with her opponents, but also in her home province of Alberta, and with politicians who otherwise share her political leanings.It has also put federal Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre on the defensive in the early days of the country's short federal electoral race.In January, while Trump was still president-elect, Smith had what she called a ""friendly and constructive conversation"" with him at Mar-a-Lago about the two countries' shared energy relationship.Smith also told Breitbart that Poilievre brought a perspective that ""would be very much in sync, I think, with the new direction in America"", adding that a Conservative government in Canada would help smooth relations with the US.The interview resurfaced this week as federal leaders were busy campaigning ahead of April's election, and Smith was quickly criticized by Poilievre's political opponents.",Positive
"Wounded Palestinians dying over lack of supplies, US surgeon who worked in Gaza says Dr Mark Perlmutter says doctors are working without soap, antibiotics or x-ray facilities, as Israel has resumed its offensive against Hamas.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cdrxr7np4xzo,"– An American surgeon who's been working in two Gaza hospitals for the past three weeks has said that wounded Palestinian patients have died because of the lack of equipment and supplies.Dr Mark Perlmutter says that doctors have had to work in operating rooms without soap, antibiotics or x-ray facilities, as Israel has resumed its offensive against Hamas in Gaza.A 15-year-old girl who was hit by Israeli machine gun fire while riding her bicycle was one of the many wounded children that Dr Perlmutter said he had to operate on.The Israeli government has said the renewed attacks that its military is carrying out in Gaza are aimed at forcing Hamas to release all the remaining hostages.Dr Perlmutter has told the BBC that Barhoum was in the hospital to receive further medical treatment.He says that as a patient in hospital, Barhoum had a right to be protected under the Geneva Convention.The stress levels on us are not even approachable to what happens even to the Palestinian medical students that work with us, whose stress levels are insane, as with the nurses and the techs in the operating room, let alone the Palestinian surgeons.""The IDF operates in accordance with international law, targeting only military objectives while taking feasible measures to mitigate harm to civilians,"" it told the BBC.",Negative
Decision day in court for Marine Le Pen's French presidential hopes,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn91lzrrx2qo,"– France's Marine Le Pen faces a make-or-break moment on Monday, as a judge rules on whether she should be banned from the next presidential election.The hard-right leader, who is ahead of all her rivals in the 2027 race, will be in court at 10:00 local time (09:00 BST) for the verdict of a party-funding trial targeting her National Rally (RN) party.At the trial's conclusion in November, the state prosecutor demanded guilty verdicts for Le Pen and 24 others accused of using EU parliamentary money to pay party salaries.But to general surprise the prosecutor also said that Le Pen's punishment should be not just a 300,000 (£250,000) fine and prison term, but also ineligibility from running for public office for five years.The three judges are not obliged to follow the prosecutor's recommendations.But if they do, it would mean Le Pen, who is 56, being barred from standing in a presidential election in which she is tipped as a potential winner.""It's my political death they are after,"" she said in November.One result of Le Pen being declared unable to run in 2027 could be to weaken still further the minority French government of Prime Minister Franois Bayrou to keep her from power.But years of ""detoxification"" after she eclipsed her father Jean-Marie Le Pen at the head of the party have made the anti-RN vote far less than it used to be, while victories for the hard-right in other countries have helped lift the taboo of an RN government.If Le Pen is barred from running, her logical replacement would be Jordan Bardella, the 29-year-old party president who was being groomed to be her eventual prime minister.However party insiders admit there has been little internal preparation for what would be widely seen as a huge and destabilising political earthquake.",Positive
Starmer and Trump discuss 'productive negotiations' on economic deal,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/crrzl1l9w95o,"– British negotiators are trying to win a last-minute exemption ahead of Trump's 25% levy on car imports, which is expected to come in on Wednesday.Trump has imposed a series of tariffs targeting goods from other countries in the first few months of his second term in the White House, with threats of wider taxes also being imposed. But Sir Keir Starmer has also said the UK ""reserves the right"" to introduce reciprocal tariffs on the US if a deal to exempt the UK cannot be reached.The government has argued the UK has a relatively equal trading relationship with the US, compared to its other partners. The Sunday night phone call between the pair comes after sources at No 10 said the government was prepared to retaliate against US trade taxes if needed. Also in their call on Sunday, the two leaders discussed continuing to pressure Russia over the Ukraine war, Downing Street's spokesperson said. Trump began the call by sending King Charles III his best wishes, after the monarch experienced temporary side effects during cancer treatment earlier in the week.",Negative
