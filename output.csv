"Bowen: Israel is gambling Hezbollah will crumple but it faces a well-armed, angry enemy The Lebanese armed group has - like Israel - spent years preparing and is more formidable than Hamas in Gaza.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c93pg1qpxxzo,"– Israel's leaders are jubilant about the progress of the offensive against Hezbollah that started with the detonation of weaponized pagers and radios and moved on to intense and deadly airstrikes.The fight between Israel and Hezbollah started in the 1980s.But this border war began the day after Hamas attacked Israel on 7 October, when Hassan Nasrallah ordered his men to begin a limited, but almost daily barrage over the border to support Hamas.Israel's leader, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, believes the current offensive is making big progress towards his declared objective of tipping the balance of power away from Hezbollah.He wants to stop Hezbollah firing rockets over the border into Israel.Israel believes that a ferocious offensive will coerce Hezbollah into doing what it wants, inflicting so much pain that its leader Hassan Nasrallah and his allies and backers in Iran decide that the price of resistance is too high.The victory created the shape of the current conflict as Israel captured the West Bank, including east Jerusalem, the Gaza Strip and the Golan Heights.It is not a good comparison. Israel has inflicted heavy blows.But so far it has not stopped Hezbollah's capacity or will to fire into Israel.Israel's earlier wars with Hezbollah were grinding, attritional and never produced a decisive victory for either side.",Negative

"One in three children are short-sighted, study suggests There was a notable rise after Covid when children spent less time outdoors, researchers say.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0m099zm4wyo,"– Children's eyesight is steadily getting worse with one in three now short-sighted or unable to see things in the distance clearly, a global analysis suggests.Short-sightedness, or myopia, is a growing global health concern which is set to affect millions more children by 2050, the study warns.The highest rates are in Asia— 85% of children in Japan and 73% in South Korea are short-sighted with more than 40% affected in China and Russia.The study, published in the British Journal of Ophthalmology, looked at research involving more than five million children and teenagers from 50 countries across all six continents.Myopia usually starts during primary school years and tends to worsen until the eye has stopped growing, at about 20 years of age.Although Asia is expected to have the highest levels compared with all other continents by 2050, with nearly 69% short-sighted, developing countries may also reach 40%, the researchers say.Children should spend at least two hours outside every day, particularly between the age of seven and nine, to reduce their chances of being short-sighted, say UK eye experts.It is not clear if it is the presence of natural sunlight, the exercise taken outdoors or the fact that children's eyes are focusing on objects that are further away that makes the difference.Myopia usually starts during primary school years and tends to worsen until the eye has stopped growing, at about 20 years of age.There are factors that make it much more likely—living in East Asia is one of those.It is also down to genetics—the traits children inherit from their parents—but there are other factors too, such as the particularly young age (two years old) that children start their education in places like Singapore and Hong Kong.Myopia cannot be cured but it can be corrected with glasses or contact lenses.",Negative
