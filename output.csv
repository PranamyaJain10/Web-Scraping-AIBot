"Katty Kay: What’s really behind America’s men v women election With polls showing a stark gender divide, the race is shaping up to be a battle of the sexes. Why?",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cjr430gry81o,"– Donald Trump enjoys a huge lead among men, while women tell pollsters they prefer Kamala Harris by a similarly large margin. The political gender gap reflects a decade of social upheaval and could help decide the US election.For the first woman of color to secure a presidential nomination, and only the second woman to ever get this close, Kamala Harris goes to great lengths not to talk about her identity.“Listen, I am running because I believe that I am the best person to do this job at this moment for all Americans, regardless of race and gender,” the vice-president said in a CNN interview last month.And yet, despite all her efforts to neutralise the subject, gender is shaping up to be the defining issue of this campaign.“Madame President” would be a new thing for America and it’s reasonable to assume that while many voters love the idea, some find the novelty a little unnerving.The Harris campaign won’t say it publicly, but one official acknowledged to me recently that they do believe there is “hidden sexism” here that will deter some people from voting for any woman for president.It’s 2024 and few people want to be the jerk who’ll tell a pollster outright that they don’t think a woman is fit for the Oval Office (though plenty are prepared to share misogynistic memes on social media).",Positive

"Chaos and political drama rock Japan's snap election Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba made a political gamble, and it backfired, leaving a weakened ruling party.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx2nn16wrk2o,"– Japanese elections are normally steady and boring affairs.This snap election was neither.The dramatic vote follows a political funding corruption scandal, revealed last year, which implicated senior lawmakers from the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) and cabinet members, tarnishing the party's image and angering the public.The electorate made that anger felt in this election and sent a strong message to the LDP, punishing it at the ballot box.According to best estimates, the LDP, which has been in power almost continuously since 1955, has lost its single party majority in the country's powerful lower house.LDP also lost its majority as a governing coalition.Its junior coalition partner Komeito lost several of its seats, including that of its chief, as well, meaning that even with its partner, the LDP is still unable to achieve the 233 seats it needs for a majority.What that leaves Japan with is a weakened ruling party and a splintered opposition.Japan has long been seen as a beacon of political stability—a safe haven for investors and a reliable diplomatic partner in an increasingly unstable Asia Pacific.This political chaos in Japan is concerning not just for its public, but also its neighbors and allies.However the LDP enters power, it will do so weakened, with its hands tied in coalition concessions.The task of turning the economy around, creating coherent policies for wages and welfare and maintaining overall political stability will not be easy.Harder still will be regaining the trust and respect of a public weary of politics.",Positive
