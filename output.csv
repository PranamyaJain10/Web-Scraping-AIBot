Representative Ted Lieu, a long-serving member of the House who sits on the Foreign Affairs Committee: ""Nobody is celebrating President Trump and Vice President Vance's embarrassing behavior in the Oval Office more than Vladimir Putin.

How the Trump-Zelensky talks collapsed in 10 fiery minutes There were major flashpoints throughout their meeting - here are four of the most   animated.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c2erwgwy8vgo,"– Ukraine's president had been hoping to leave the White House on Friday after positive talks with Donald Trump, capped with the signing of a minerals deal giving the US a real stake in his country's future, if not an outright security guarantee.Instead Volodymyr Zelensky faced an extraordinary dressing down in front of the world's media, after President Trump and his Vice-President JD Vance demanded that he show more gratitude for years of US support.The Ukrainian president pushed back at suggestions from his more powerful partners that he should work harder to agree a ceasefire with Vladimir Putin.They responded that he was being ""disrespectful.""Zelensky was eventually told to leave the White House early before the pair could even take the stage for a scheduled news conference.Trump tends to the war as a kind of binary conflict between two sides who should both take their share of burden or blame for the fighting and its causes.But Zelensky was trying to warn of catastrophic consequences of this thinking.This exchange may win Zelensky plaudits among those who wanted to see him to stand up to Trump; but this moment could also decide an era of war and peace in Europe.",Positive

President Trump had already called him a dictator and said Ukraine started the war—which is a lie.Now the US-Ukraine alliance nurtured by Joe Biden is in pieces.The public breakdown also signals a major crisis looming between European members of Nato and the US. The biggest is whether President Trump would keep the promise his predecessor Harry Truman made in 1949 to treat an attack on a Nato ally as an attack on America.The security of Ukraine is coming a poor second—and Europeans are worrying theirs is too.President Zelensky's refusal to make those concessions has infuriated Trump.There are suspicions now that the public row was—in the words of one diplomatic observer—a planned political mugging: either to force Zelensky to do America's bidding, or to precipitate a crisis that would allow them to blame him for whatever happens next.If Trump follows the breakdown of talks with a freeze on military aid, Ukraine will fight on.",Negative
