"Why was there a wall near runway at S Korea plane crash airport? An air safety expert says lives could have been saved if the ""obstruction"" was not there.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0mvynnxzzmo,"– South Korea's transport ministry has said that other airports in the country and some overseas have the equipment installed with concrete structures.However officials will examine whether it should have been made with lighter materials that would break more easily upon impact.Chris Kingswood, a pilot with 48 years' experience who has flown the same type of aircraft involved in the crash, told BBC News: ""Obstacles within a certain range and distance of the runway are required to be frangible, which means that if an aircraft strikes them that they do break.""It does seem unusual that it's such a rigid thing.The concrete structure holds a navigation system that assists aircraft landings—known as a localiser—according to South Korea's Yonhap News Agency.At 4m high, it is covered with dirt and was raised to keep the localiser level with the runway to ensure it functions properly, Yonhap reported.The plane came down some distance along the 2,800m runway and appeared to land without using its wheels or any other landing gear.Mr Learmount said the landing was ""as good as a flapless/gearless touchdown could be: wings level, nose not too high to avoid breaking the tail"" and the plane had not sustained substantial damage as it slid along the runway.The reason so many people died was not the landing as such, but the fact that the aircraft collided with a very hard obstruction just beyond the runway end.""The aircraft collided with a very hard obstruction just beyond the runway end,"" he said.",Negative
