Gay men used waacking to express themselves on the dance floor and push back against the hate and discrimination they experienced.In fact, many people explore their sexual identity through the dance style because it allows space for introspection and expression,"" says Ayushi Amrute, who has been waacking since 2012 and is a frequent host of Red Bull's Your House Is Waack - a waacking jam for dancers across the country.""We [the handful of Indian dancers who began waacking over a decade ago] learnt waacking the hard way; by doing our own research, learning about the history of the dance and connecting with dancers in countries where waacking was popular,"" says Amrute.Patil remembers learning waacking the same way.",Positive
