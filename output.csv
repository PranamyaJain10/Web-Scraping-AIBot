Trump calls Zelensky a 'dictator' as rift between two leaders deepens The comments come as the latest salvo in a public war of words between the US and Ukrainian leaders.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cjev2j70v19o,"– President Trump has spent the day attacking Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky, calling him a ""dictator"" and deepening the rift between the two leaders.His attacks came after Zelensky, reacting to US-Russia talks in Saudi Arabia from which Kyiv was excluded, said the US president was ""living in a disinformation space"" governed by Moscow.Speaking at a Saudi-backed investment meeting in Florida, Trump said the only thing Zelensky ""was really good at was playing Joe Biden like a fiddle.""If you look at the real world instead of just firing off a tweet, then you know who in Europe has to live in the conditions of a dictatorship: people in Russia, people in Belarus,"" she told broadcaster ZDF.Speaking in Florida, Trump called Zelensky a ""dictator"", just hours after using the same word in a Truth Social post about the Ukrainian president.""He refuses to have elections. He's low in the real Ukrainian polls.How can you be high with every city being demolished?"" Trump said.He also referenced his attempt to get rare-earth minerals from Ukraine, accusing Zelensky's government of ""breaking the deal.""The former prime minister of Ukraine, Arseniy Yatsenyuk, told the BBC that Russia was ""popping champagne right now"" in response to Trump's comments.""Volodymyr Zelensky is a completely legitimate president,"" he said.The world faced the choice to be ""with Putin or with peace.""",Negative
"Trump echoes Russia as he upends US position on Ukraine While the sudden change in US foreign policy is dramatic, the president has been charting this course for years.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c36wn949jxno,"– If there were any lingering doubts about Donald Trump's view of the Ukraine war and America's support of Kyiv's fight against Russia, he put them to rest in stark terms on Wednesday.Lashing out at Volodymyr Zelensky, who less than three years ago received a standing ovation in Congress for his efforts to resist Russia's invasion, the US president labelled Ukraine's leader a ""dictator"" and accused him of corruption.He said Zelensky wanted to ""keep the gravy train"" of foreign aid running, a day after he appeared to blame Ukraine—not Russia—for starting the war.Trump's latest broadside against Zelensky came after the Ukrainian leader publicly rejected an American bid to gain access to—and profits from—Ukrainian minerals.Zelensky better move fast, or he is not going to have a country left,"" Trump wrote.It's been just under a week since Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin had a lengthy phone conversation.Trump has also been consistent in his solicitous views toward Putin and the Russian perspective.The US president seems serious, however, about reducing American military commitments to Europe and pivoting resources instead toward containing China.Trump's latest comments reflect an American president who is wielding total authority over his party and the full power of government to turn a transactional 'America First' foreign policy view into reality.",Negative
'Captain America must die in China': Nationalism fuels Ne Zha 2 fans Record-breaking film Ne Zha 2 is a symbol of Chinese pride - fans are shutting down criticism of it.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cgl026rw7xpo,"– It's not Captain America that's dying, but America that's dying,"" reads the title of an essay on an online forum analyzing the movie's lack of appeal in China. Meanwhile, some are critical that Ne Zha 2, which premiered outside China this month, did not get enough screenings in North American cinemas.Ne Zha 2 hit the screens in China on 29 January, among a string of high-profile movies designed to capture an annual surge of cinemagoers during the Lunar New Year holiday.It quickly towered over the competition, crossing the $1bn milestone in less than two weeks - even more impressive considering China's sluggish economy.Ne Zha 2 is being hailed as a symbol of progress in Chinese film and a sign that locally-made productions are becoming competitive globally.Criticising the plot flaws is equated to being unpatriotic; unreservedly condemning other films released in the same period; replacing deep discussion with a war between fans and haters... This is definitely not a good cultural environment.""I don't care if Ne Zha 2 can survive overseas, but Captain America 4 must die in China,"" reads a popular slogan that has been repeated on multiple posts on social media.",Negative

The pyrotechnics were in fact caused by a Space X Falcon 9 rocket re-entering the Earth's atmosphere.There are reports of sightings in Denmark, Sweden, and England.Pieces of the rocket then crashed into Poland and, experts say, may also have landed in Ukraine.The debris zipped over England at around 17,000mph, then parts of Scandinavia then parts crashed into eastern Europe at a few hundred miles an hour.""So far large pieces of debris have been confirmed in Poland but Dr McDowell suspects that pieces have crashed into western Ukraine where the comet-like streaks of light in the sky ""were clearly visible.""This is the fourth incident recently with a SpaceX Falcon which is causing concern,"" Harvard University astrophysicist Dr Jonathan McDowell told the BBC.The SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket is used to transport people and payloads into the Earth's atmosphere.It is designed to be reusable.The debris appears to have damaged a light fixture in the warehouse's yard.Mr Borucki contacted the police who, working alongside the Polish space agency Polsa, determined that the unidentified object was debris from a Falcon 9 rocket, manufactured by Elon Musk's company SpaceX.""We are investigating how the object ended up in this location, but the important thing is that no one was harmed,"" police spokesperson Andrzej Borowiak said.A similar piece of debris was discovered in a forest near the Polish village of Wiry, according to Polish police.",Neutral
"'Help us': Hundreds deported from US held in Panama hotel Indians, Afghans and Sri Lankans are among the undocumented migrants unable to leave the hotel after being deported.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3rndygqll7o,"– An Iranian woman who has lived in Panama for a number of years told the BBC she was in contact with one of the migrants inside the hotel.She said they were ""terrified"" of the possibility of being returned to Iran.The woman, who asked not to be named, said she went to the hotel to offer her help as a Farsi translator but was told they already had one.She added, however, that people inside the hotel said that was not true.Using a hidden mobile phone, since contact with those outside of the Decpolis Hotel is reportedly not allowed, the Iranian woman said the migrant told her there were several children in the hotel, that they have been denied a lawyer, and that they are not allowed to leave their rooms even to eat.The BBC contacted both the Decpolis Hotel and the Panamanian government to ask about the conditions inside the building, but did not receive a response.According to the government, this group will be transferred to a camp in the province of Darién, which has temporarily housed migrants crossing the jungle en route to the US.The woman in the video said her life would be in danger if she returned to Iran because of possible reprisals of the government.Her intention, she said, is to ask for political asylum.Analysts say this is difficult to obtain without access to a lawyer—even more so when the Panamanian government announced that this access would not be offered to deportees.President José Ral Mulino agreed that Panama would become a ""bridge"" country for deportees.",Negative

""Yoon's rhetoric almost completely matches that of past dictators, and he is the first president to use this anti-communist ideology so blatantly since Korea became a democracy in 1987,"" said Mr Shin.Not only has Yoon accused the parliament, led by the opposition Democratic Party, of being riddled with Pyongyang sympathisers, but he has dangled the idea that North Korea, with help from China, rigged last year's parliamentary election.""This is fake news cooked up by to demonise the opposition and justify his completely undemocratic move,"" one Democratic Party lawmaker, Wi Sung-lac, told the BBC.Two months on from his failed coup, an anti-communist frenzy is gripping Yoon's supporters, young and old.Even some who had never given North Korea or communism much thought are now convinced their dynamic democracy is on the brink of being turned into a leftist dictatorship—and that their leader had no choice but to remove people's democratic rights in order to protect them from both Pyongyang and Beijing.",Positive
