New photos released as NYPD hunt insurance boss killer Police are still working to determine a motive in the slaying of insurance executive Brian Thompson.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c7ve36zg0e5o,"– Police in New York have released two photos of an unmasked individual wanted for questioning over the killing of a healthcare chief executive.UnitedHealthcare boss Brian Thompson, 50, was fatally shot in the back on Wednesday morning outside the Hilton hotel in Midtown Manhattan. The attacker fled the scene without taking any of Thompson's belongings. Investigators are also using facial recognition technology and bullet casings with cryptic messages written on them to track down the suspect. Police are testing three bullet casings and three live rounds found at the scene for DNA.The words ""deny,"" ""defend"" and ""depose"" were discovered on the casings, two law enforcement sources told CBS. Investigators believe this could be a reference to the ""three D's of insurance""—a known reference made by opponents of the industry.The terms refer to tactics used by insurance companies to refuse payment claims by patients in America's complicated and mostly privately run healthcare system.The words resemble—but are not exactly the same as—the title of a book called Delay, Deny, Defend: Why Insurance Companies Don't Pay Claims and What You Can Do About It.",Negative
