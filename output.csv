Gaza aid fears as Israel bans UN Palestinian refugee agency Israel passes two laws which Western governments fear could have devastating consequences for civilians in the Gaza Strip.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4gp2ejzpxeo,"– Israel's parliament has voted to pass legislation banning the UN's Palestinian refugee agency (Unrwa) from operating within Israel and Israeli-occupied East Jerusalem, within three months.The US State Department said Unrwa played a ""critical"" role in distributing humanitarian aid in the Gaza Strip.Almost all of the enclave's population of more than 2 million people are dependent on aid and services from the agency.Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said that ""Unrwa workers involved in terrorist activities against Israel must be held accountable"", but added that ""sustained humanitarian aid must remain available in Gaza"".""We stand ready to work with our international partners to ensure Israel continues to facilitate humanitarian aid to civilians in Gaza in a way that does not threaten Israel's security,"" he said on X.Israel has objected to Unrwa for decades, although this opposition has intensified in recent years.The UN investigated Israel's claim and fired nine of those accused, but it said Israel had not provided evidence for broader allegations.Unrwa Commissioner-General Philippe Lazzarini condemned the ban as ""unprecedented"" and said it ""opposes the UN Charter and violates the State of Israel's obligations under international law.""He said people in Gaza had already endured ""sheer hell"", adding: ""It will deprive over 650,000 girls and boys there from education, putting at risk an entire generation of children.""",Negative
What satellite images reveal about Israel's strikes on Iran BBC Verify has analysed satellite imagery from Iran to assess damage from Israeli air strikes.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy7dkgz71x6o,"– Satellite images analysed by BBC Verify show damage to a number of military sites in Iran from Israeli air strikes on Saturday.They include sites experts say were used for missile production and air defense, including one previously linked to Iran's nuclear program.The site has been linked to rocket production according to experts from the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS).Comparing high-resolution satellite imagery taken on 9 September with an image captured on 27 October, it appears that at least four structures have been significantly damaged.Iran launched a missile attack on Israel at the start of October for the second time this year, after firing 300 missiles and drones in April.The New York Times cited Israeli officials as saying that the Abadan oil refinery was one of the sites targeted in its air strikes on Saturday morning.Iranian authorities confirmed on Saturday that Khuzestan province had been targeted by Israel.Iran launched a missile attack on Israel at the start of October for the second time this year, after firing 300 missiles and drones in April. Satellite imagery isn't always conclusive in identifying damaged structures.For example, a photograph we have verified showing smoke rising near Hazrat Amir Brigade Air Defense base suggested it had been successfully targeted.But satellite imagery of the area captured on Sunday has too many shadows to confirm any damage to the site.Iran launched a missile attack on Israel at the start of October for the second time this year, after firing 300 missiles and drones in April.",Negative

Smuggler selling ‘fast track’ Channel crossing speaks to BBC undercover reporter More migrants from Vietnam than any other nation are taking small boats to the UK.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clyd31n0pv1o,"– The Vietnamese people smuggler emerged, briefly and hesitantly, from the shadows of a scraggly forest close to the northern French coastline.“Move away from the others. Come this way, fast,” he said, gesturing across a disused railway line to a member of our team, who had spent weeks posing undercover as a potential customer.Moments later, the smuggler—a tall figure with bright dyed blonde hair—turned away sharply, like a fox startled, and vanished down a narrow path into the woods.Earlier this year, Vietnam emerged— abruptly—as the biggest single source of new migrants seeking to cross the Channel to the UK illegally in small boats. Arrivals surged from 1,306 in the whole of 2023, to 2,248 in the first half of 2024.Our investigation—including interviews with Vietnamese smugglers and clients, French police, prosecutors, and charities—reveal how Vietnamese migrants are paying double the usual rate for an ""elite"" small boat smuggling experience that is faster and more streamlined.It is clear, from several recent visits to the camps around Dunkirk and Calais, that the Vietnamese gangs and their clients operate separately from other groups.The Vietnamese do not control the small boat crossings themselves, which are largely overseen by a handful of Iraqi Kurdish gangs.It is clear that Vietnamese smugglers tend to bring their clients to the camps in northern France when the weather is already looking promising and a crossing is imminent.",Neutral
