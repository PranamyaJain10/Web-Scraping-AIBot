To do that, they've opened offices in places where Democrats have usually not campaigned but where strategists see new potential. The goal is to churn out as many votes as possible in the least likely places—even if it means venturing deep into politically unfriendly territory.North Carolina, located along a rural stretch of the state's south-eastern coastline, is one of those places.Last month, a few dozen Democrats were gathered there at a local bed-and-breakfast to eat pulled pork and talk party strategy.The party has made big investments in the state, including signing up 32,000 volunteers, hiring over 340 staff members, and opening up 28 offices, including in rural Republican-led counties like Onslow.Although Harris has little chance of winning a majority of votes in these deep-red parts of the country, this election will be won on the margins.Trump beat Biden in the state by 1.3% in 2020, but polls now rate it as a ""toss-up"" between him and Kamala Harris, giving Democrats fresh hope in a state where losing has been the norm.",Positive
