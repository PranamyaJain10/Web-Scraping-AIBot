Trump to be sentenced over hush money case but judge signals no jail time Trump had attempted to use his presidential election victory to dismiss the case against him.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c390mrmxndyo,"– A judge has ordered that Donald Trump will be sentenced on 10 January in his hush-money case in New York - less than two weeks before he is set to be sworn in as president.New York Justice Juan Merchan signaled he would not sentence Trump to jail time, probation or a fine, but instead give him an ""unconditional discharge"", and wrote in his order that the president-elect could appear in person or virtually for the hearing.Trump had attempted to use his presidential election victory to have the case against him dismissed.His team criticised the judge's decision to go forward with sentencing and said the ""lawless"" case should be dismissed ""immediately.""In his latest motion against the case, Trump had argued the case would hang over him during his presidency and impede his ability to govern.The charges related to attempts to cover up reimbursements to his ex-lawyer, Michael Cohen, who in the final days of the 2016 election campaign paid off the adult-film star to remain silent about an alleged sexual encounter with Trump.The president-elect has denied all wrongdoing and pleaded not guilty, arguing the case was an attempt to harm his 2024 presidential campaign.Trump had initially, and unsuccessfully, argued the case against him ran afoul of a Supreme Court ruling on presidential immunity.However, last month Justice Merchan ruled Trump's hush money conviction was valid.Trump is currently set to be the first convicted felon to serve in the White House.",Negative
"Johnson re-elected as House Speaker in razor-tight margin Republican Mike Johnson could only lose two votes from his own party in his bid for speaker re-election, and he nearly did.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cj0r6mg1yr7o,"– House Speaker Mike Johnson survived a razor-thin vote to remain House Speaker in a drama-filled, highly-anticipated vote that marked the start of complete Republican control in Washington.Johnson could only afford to lose two votes because of the tight margin of control Republicans have in Congress. Donald Trump previously endorsed Johnson for the role of House speaker, saying ""a win for Mike today will be a big win for the Republican Party."" The House Speaker is one of the most powerful posts in Washington, controlling the lower chamber of the US Congress second in line to the presidency after the vice president.The vote for speaker requires a candidate to receive the support of a majority of the House— 218 votes. Johnson, Louisiana Republican, was backed by nearly all Republicans in his bid for re-election. But because of a razor-thin Republican majority in the House, Johnson could only stand to face opposition from two Republicans. Norman told reporters after the election that he changed his vote after speaking with Johnson in a room outside the House chamber. He said Johnson told him there would be more conservatives at the table during negotiations, less deals made between congressional and committee leadership without outside input from other lawmakers and enough time to read bill text before votes are scheduled.",Positive

Americans only pay attention to spectacles and violence,"" adding, ""I need to cleanse my mind of the brothers I lost and relieve myself of the burden of the lives I took."" Las Vegas FBI agent Spencer Evans told reporters on Friday as officials laid out new information on the incident.Data uncovered from Mr Livelsberger's phone, including a series of notes he appeared to have written, suggest that the 37-year-old suffered from Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) related to his time in combat, Las Vegas police said.Mr Livelsberger was a decorated special forces intelligence sergeant who was serving in Germany, but was on approved leave at the time of the incident.Sheriff Kevin McMahill with the Las Vegas Police Department said authorities have not determined why MR Livelsberger chose that location for the explosion, but added that evidence suggests it was one of multiple locations he had considered.Mr Evans called it ""a tragic case of suicide involving a heavily-decorated combat veteran who was struggling with PTSD and other issues.""Mr Livelsberger was a decorated special forces intelligence sergeant who was serving in Germany, but was on approved leave at the time of the incident.His father told BBC's US partner CBS News that his son was in Colorado to see his wife and eight-month-old daughter.He said he last spoke to his son at Christmas and that everything seemed normal.Mr Livelsberger also mentioned political grievances.Mr Evans called it ""a tragic case of suicide involving a heavily-decorated combat veteran who was struggling with PTSD and other issues.""Mr Livelsberger had rented the Tesla Cybertruck from a mobile application called Turo in Colorado on Dec. 28 and had driven it more than 800 miles to Las Vegas.Mr Livelsberger's body was burned beyond recognition, police said, but his identity has been confirmed via a DNA sample that authorities obtained from a family member.",Negative

"China's overqualified youth taking jobs as drivers, labourers and film extras With high youth unemployment rates, Chinese graduates are resorting to working as waiters, cleaners and movie extras.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ce8nlpy2n1lo,"– China is now a country where a high-school handyman has a master's degree in physics; a cleaner is qualified in environmental planning; a delivery driver studied philosophy, and a PhD graduate from the prestigious Tsinghua University ends up applying to work as an auxiliary police officer.These are real cases in a struggling economy—and it is not hard to find more like them.""My dream job was to work in investment banking,"" says Sun Zhan as he prepares to start his shift as a waiter in a hot pot restaurant in the southern city of Nanjing.The 25-year-old recently graduated with a master's degree in finance.

US top doctor calls for cancer warnings on alcohol,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cj90x3np0zpo,"– America's top doctor has called for risk warnings on alcoholic beverages, similar to the labels on cigarettes, following new research that links the drinks to seven types of cancer.The advisory from US Surgeon General Vivek Murthy says the ""majority of Americans are unaware of this risk"" that leads to about 100,000 cases of cancer and 20,000 deaths annually in the US.It would require an act of Congress to change the existing warning labels, which have not been updated since 1988.Mr Murthy has also called for reassessing recommended limits for alcohol consumption and boosting education efforts regarding alcoholic drinks and cancer.The World Health Organization's Global Status Report for Alcohol and Health in 2018, cited in Mr Murthy's report, said 47 member states mandated health and safety warnings on alcohol, up from 31 in 2014.""The direct link between alcohol consumption and cancer risk is well-established for at least seven types of cancer...regardless of the type of alcohol (e.g., beer, wine, and spirits) that is consumed,"" Mr Murthy said in a statement.This includes increased risk of cancer of the breast (in women), throat, liver, oesophagus, mouth, larynx, and colon.The warning labels are currently required to state that women who are pregnant should not drink alcohol due to birth defect risks.It also must state that ""consumption of alcoholic beverages impairs your ability to drive a car or operate machinery, and may cause health problems.""Over the last two decades, countries have increasingly introduced warning labels to inform consumers about the health risks of alcohol.",Negative
Soldiers block police as S Korea enters uncharted territory,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cp8n0ng2m88o,"– South Korea's acting President Choi Sang-mok, and how far his powers extend; whether he could and should sack the president's security chief and force the team to allow his arrest.Although investigators have until 6 January to attempt this arrest again—this is when the warrant runs out—it is unlikely they will go in once more without changing their strategy or negotiating with the security team in advance.This is totally uncharted territory for South Korea.It is the first time a sitting president has ever faced arrest, so there is no rule book to follow—but the current situation is nonetheless astonishing.The investigating officers said they abandoned efforts to arrest Yoon not only because it looked impossible, but because they were concerned for their safety.Yoon has also spurred on his supporters, who have gathered in force outside his residence every day since the arrest warrant was issued.Although most people in South Korea are upset and angry at Yoon's decision to impose martial law, a core of his supporters have stayed loyal.This is how things reached this point, where investigators felt they had no choice but to bring him in by force.",Negative
Trump and Musk's interventions prompt new diplomatic challenge for UK,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cjwl569p57lo,"– In Donald Trump's first term, governments around the world braced for his morning social media posts.The main difference—four years on—is that Trump is no longer alone at the keyboard; his increasingly powerful fellow traveller, Elon Musk, is even more prolific, using his own platform, X, to attack the British government across the board.Musk has issued a torrent of tweets attacking Sir Keir Starmer personally, accusing the prime minister of not doing enough to prosecute child grooming gangs while he was the director of public prosecutions.Musk has shared several posts on X calling for the release of Yaxley-Lennon, who was jailed in October after admitting contempt of court by repeating false claims against a Syrian refugee.As for Labour, it seems keen to avoid picking a fight with one of the world's richest men who could one day fund a rival political party.Musk's comments about child grooming scandals were ""misjudged and certainly misinformed"" but asked the billionaire to work with the UK government to tackle online child abuse.UK politicians are not alone in being the target of Musk's increasingly eccentric interventions.Trump's latest morning salvo criticised the UK government's decision to increase taxes on oil and gas firms working in the North Sea, in part to help fund renewable energy.On his platform, Truth Social, Trump responded to a report about a US oil firm leaving the region, saying: ""The U.K. is making a very big mistake. Open up the North Sea. Get rid of Windmills!""",Negative
