Perfect storm as Trump's mass deportation drive collides with city of immigrants The clashes over local Ice raids come as the White House orders immigration agents to ramp up enforcement.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3d47v7394go,"– President Trump's decision to send 700 US Marines and 4,000 National Guard troops to the Los Angeles area to support the federal response to the unrest has opened a volatile chapter in his mass deportation campaign.The location of the raids and subsequent protests—a liberal-leaning city in a state controlled by Democrats—also gave the White House an ideal public foil as it seeks to show progress on removing illegal immigrants and instilling law and order.The raids in America's second-biggest city are unfolding against the backdrop of an aggressive push to raise arrest and deportation numbers, as the administration has been disappointed with its current pace.The Department of Homeland Security said in a press release that the immigrants detained in the recent Los Angeles raids included individuals convicted of sex crimes, burglary, and drug related charges, among other offences.LA City Councilmember Ysabel Jurado said that a Friday raid at a warehouse in the Fashion District ""was not about public safety, it was a fear driven, state violence designed to silence, to intimidate, to disappear.""I understand the importance of deporting criminal aliens, but what we are witnessing are arbitrary measures to hunt down people who are complying with their immigration hearings—in many cases, with credible fear of persecution claims—all driven by a Miller-like desire to satisfy a self-fabricated deportation goal,"" she added.",Negative
"RFK Jr sacks entire US vaccine committee The US health secretary, a vaccine sceptic who has been criticised by health experts, said the panel was 'plagued' with conflicts of interest.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clyge27y2g9o,"– US Health Secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr, a vaccine sceptic, has removed all 17 members of a committee that issues official government recommendations on vaccinations.Announcing the move in an editorial in the Wall Street Journal, Kennedy said that conflicts of interest on the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) were responsible for undermining trust in vaccinations.Kennedy said he wanted to ""ensure the American people receive the safest vaccines possible.""Doctors and health experts have criticised Kennedy's longstanding questioning of the safety and efficacy of a number of vaccines, although in his Senate confirmation hearing he said he is ""not going to take them away."" On Monday he said he was ""retiring"" all of the ACIP panel members.Most of the 17 panellists were appointed in January 2025, in the last days of President Biden's term.Most of the members are practicing doctors and experts attached to major university medical centers.Kennedy noted that if he did not remove the committee members, President Trump would not have been able to appoint a majority on the panel until 2028.""The committee has been plagued with persistent conflicts of interest and has become little more than a rubber stamp for any vaccine,"" Kennedy wrote.He claimed that health authorities and drug companies were responsible for a ""crisis of public trust"" that some try to explain ""by blaming misinformation or antiscience attitudes.""Acip members are required to disclose conflicts of interest, which are posted online, and to recuse themselves from voting on decisions where they may have a conflict.""The problem isn't necessarily that ACIP members are corrupt,"" Kennedy wrote.Most likely aim to serve the public interest as they understand it.""The problem is their immersion in a system of industry-aligned incentives and paradigms that enforce a narrow pro-industry orthodoxy.""Bill Cassidy, a Republican Senator from Louisiana who is also a doctor, reported that he received commitments from the health secretary that ACIP would be maintained ""without changes.""Of course, now the fear is that the fear is that the Acip will be filled up with people who know nothing about vaccines except suspicion.Kennedy noted on X: ""Of course, now the fear is that the fear is that the Acip will be filled up with people who will be filled up with people who know nothing about vaccines except suspicion.",Negative

Israel's foreign ministry said the boat had docked and that those aboard the vessel, including Swedish activist Greta Thunberg, were ""undergoing medical examinations to ensure they are in good health."" The Madleen was aiming to bring a ""symbolic"" amount of aid to Gaza in defiance of an Israeli naval blockade.Israel dismissed it as a ""selfie yacht"", saying it would deport the passengers to their home countries.The boat set sail from Italy on 1 June to raise awareness of starvation conditions in Gaza.Israel says its blockade on Gaza is necessary to prevent weapons from reaching Hamas fighters there.The UN's human rights chief, Volker Trk, said last week Palestinians were being presented with the ""grimmest of choices: die from starvation or risk being killed while trying to access the meagre food that is being made available.""While Greta and others attempted to stage a media provocation whose sole purpose was to gain publicity - and which included less than a single truckload of aid - more than 1,200 aid trucks have entered Gaza from Israel within the past two weeks, and in addition, the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation has distributed close to 11 million meals directly to civilians in Gaza.""There are ways to deliver aid to the Gaza Strip - they do not involve Instagram selfies,"" FFC press officer Hay Sha Wiya said on Sunday.",Negative

Lively also shared details of the allegations in a New York Times article published before her lawsuit. Baldoni then brought defamation suits against Lively, her husband Ryan Reynolds, their publicist, claiming they were aiming to ruin his career and reputation with the allegations, as well as the New York Times. In a statement shared with US media, Lively's lawyers called the opinion ""a total victory and a complete vindication for Blake Lively, along with those that Justin Baldoni and parties dragged into their lawsuit, including Ryan Reynolds, Leslie Sloane and the New York Times.""While the suit against me was defeated, so many don't have the resources to fight back,"" she said, adding that she was ""more resolved than ever to continue to stand for every woman's right to have a voice in protecting themselves.""",Positive
Palestinians say local gunmen and Israeli forces opened fire near Gaza aid site Witnesses say the gunmen shot at them while organising queues for food near a site run by an Israeli- and US-backed group.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c79e0zxy2lro,"– Palestinians in Gaza say they were fired on once again as they headed to one of the aid distribution centers run by the Israeli- and US-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation on Monday.Witnesses said that for the first time they were fired on by Palestinian gunmen near the GHF site in the Tal al-Sultan area of Rafah on a route that runs through an Israeli military zone.Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry said six people were killed and 99 injured from areas designated for aid collection.The Israeli military said it was looking into the reports.The GHF said the Tal al-Sultan site did not open on Monday and that there were no incidents at two other sites which did hand out aid.It comes days after Israel's prime minister acknowledged that it was arming Palestinian clans in Gaza who were opposed to Hamas.At first, we thought they might be Palestinian youths helping with the process, but suddenly, they began shooting at us,"" Hisham Saeed Salem said.""Even those who managed to get a box of aid were targeted and shot.We still don't know who these attackers are. They took everything from us - some even stole from us during the chaos.""At first, it was the Israeli army that was shooting at civilians. But today, we were shocked to discover the presence of gangs and militias,"" he added.",Negative

China's electric cars are becoming slicker and cheaper - but is there a deeper cost? The future for EVs will inevitably involve China. But where does that leave the UK and Europe markets – and what of the questions around national security?,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy8d4v69jw6o,"– China's car industry has been developing rapidly since the country joined the World Trade Organization in 2001. But that process accelerated rapidly in 2015, when the Communist Party introduced its ""Made in China 2025"" initiative.The 10-year plan to make the country a leader in several high-tech industries, including EVs, attracted intense criticism from abroad, and particularly the US, amid claims of forced technology transfers and theft of intellectual property—all of which the Chinese government denies.Low labor costs in China, coupled with rivalry between Beijing and western powers showing no sign of subsiding, some experts are concerned Chinese vehicles could represent a security risk from hackers and third parties.Chinese brands are making massive inroads into the European market,"" says David Bailey, professor of business and economics at Birmingham Business School.The products on offer already encompass a huge range, from runabouts like the tiny Dolphin Surf to exotic supercars, like the pothole-jumping U9, from BYD's high-end sub-brand Yangwang.""We want to be number one in the British market within 10 years,"" says Steve Beattie, sales and marketing director for BYD UK.BYD is part of a wider expansion of Chinese companies and brands that some believe could change the face of the global motor industry—and which has already prompted radical action from the US government and the EU.It means once-unknown marques like Nio, Xpeng, Zeekr or Omoda could become every bit as much household names as Ford or Volkswagen.",Positive
'Scary and stressful': Indian students reconsider plans for US education,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c8re8vy4g14o,"– When 26-year-old Umar Sofi received his acceptance letter from Columbia University's School of Journalism, he thought the hardest part of his journey was over. But on 27 May, when the US suddenly paused student visa appointments, the ground slipped from beneath his feet.""I was numb. I could not process what had happened,"" Mr Sofi, who lives in Indian-administered Kashmir, told the BBC.Over the last month, the BBC spoke with at least 20 students at various stages of their application process, all of whom echoed deep anxieties about their futures.More than 1.1 million international students were enrolled in US colleges in the 2023-24 school year, according to Open Doors, an organization that collects data on foreign students.Nearly a third of them, or more than 330,000, were from India.Educational consultants report that applications to US universities for the upcoming autumn semester have dropped by at least 30% because of the uncertainty.Last month President Donald Trump's administration asked US embassies across the world to stop scheduling appointments for student visas and expand social media vetting of applicants.This wider move followed a crackdown on America's elite universities like Harvard, which Trump accused of being too liberal and of not doing enough to combat antisemitism.",Negative
Canada pledges to meet Nato's 2% defence spending target within a year,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/crk25k47dlgo,"– Canada will significantly boost its defense spending to hit a NATO target of 2% of GDP years earlier than planned, Prime Minister Mark Carney has announced.In a speech at the University of Toronto on Monday, Carney said the action was required to ward off the ""multiplying"" threats from hostile governments, terrorist entities, and cyber criminals.The prime minister said Canada's equipment had aged, ""hindering our military preparedness.""Only one of four submarines were seaworthy and less than half the maritime fleet and land vehicles were in good working order, he said. Carney said the new strategy would have four pillars - investing more in soldiers and equipment, expanding the military's capability, strengthening the domestic defense industry, and diversifying Canada's defense partnerships.This is an age where'middle powers' must act to defend themselves knowing 'if they're not at the table, they're on the menu.'""",Positive
