Biden condemns misinformation about hurricane BBC Verify looks into claims made about the US government's response to Hurricane Helene.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/czd1q9q9gl9o,"– President Joe Biden has said the ""irresponsible and relentless promotion of disinformation and outright lies"" about the government's hurricane response is ""undermining confidence"" in rescue and recovery efforts, even as Hurricane Milton heads towards Florida. Donald Trump has been highly critical of the Biden-Harris administration's response. At multiple campaign events since the hurricane struck, Trump and his allies have claimed that government money earmarked for disaster victims has been spent on migrants who crossed illegally into the US.“Kamala spent all her Fema money - billions of dollars - on housing for illegal migrants,"" Trump said in Michigan last week.This claim is false. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema), a government agency, has a Disaster Relief Fund - worth more than $20bn (£15bn) for the last financial year - which is ring-fenced to spend on responding to hurricanes and other natural disasters.Fema also has a dedicated budget from Congress to be spent on food, shelter, transportation, and other support services for immigrants released from Department of Homeland Security (DHS) custody.This budget amounts to around $1bn over the last two financial years - not the ""billions"" Trump claims.Fema, which has now set up a fact-checking page on its website, called Trump's claim ""false"" saying, ""no money is being diverted from disaster response needs.""In 2019, while Trump was president, money was diverted from Fema's Disaster Relief Fund - around $38m - to give to Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).",Negative
