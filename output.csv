Speaking to journalists in Ukraine the morning after, Zelensky accepted the fact that Putin received the first call, ""although to be honest, it's not very pleasant.""What stung Zelensky more was that Trump, who rang him after he spoke to Putin, seemed to regard him, at best, as a junior adjunct to any peace talks.It must have been bad enough for Zelensky to hear Trump's abrupt announcement that he had welcomed Russia's President Vladimir Putin back to international diplomacy with a 90-minute phone call, to be followed by a face-to-face meeting, perhaps in Saudi Arabia.Trump is still at the easy end of what could become an impossibly tough diplomatic challenge.Making that happen is something else.His declaration before any talks with Russia start that Ukraine will not join NATO nor get back all its occupied land has been widely criticized as a poor start by a man who claims to be the world's best dealmaker.",Positive
