"Trump says Nato's new 5% defence spending pledge a 'big win' Nato leaders meeting in The Hague say they have an ""ironclad commitment to collective defence"".",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cj4en8djwyko,"– The US president had earlier appeared to raise questions about the security guarantee, referring to ""various definitions of Article Five."" But Trump said after the summit: ""I stand with [Article Five], that's why I'm here.""The Hague summit has been described by several leaders as historic, and Rutte said decisions made on Wednesday would include continued support for Ukraine while pushing for peace.The commitment to raise defense spending over 10 years involves at least 3.5% of each member state's GDP on core defense expenditure by 2035, plus up to 1.5% on a broadly defined series of investments loosely connected to security infrastructure.The Belgian government had also expressed reservations, but Prime Minister Bart de Wever told reporters that while it wouldn't be easy ""3.5% within 10 years is a realistic goal.""The nine Nato countries that missed their defense spending targets later announced their commitments to providing support for Ukraine, ""whose security contributes to ours"", adding that direct contributions to Kyiv's defense and its defense industry would be included in assessment of allies' defense spending.The US president had earlier appeared to raise questions about the security guarantee, referring to ""various definitions of Article Five.""",Positive
"CIA director says Iran's nuclear sites 'severely damaged' At a Nato summit, President Trump again maintains the raid ""obliterated"" Iran's nuclear facilities.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5yk942y437o,"– The head of the CIA has said US strikes ""severely damaged"" Iran's nuclear facilities and set them back years, diverging from a leaked intelligence report that angered President Donald Trump by downplaying the raid's impact. John Ratcliffe, the US spy agency's director, said key sites had been destroyed, though he stopped short of declaring that Iran's nuclear program had been eliminated outright. Trump again maintained the raid had ""obliterated"" Iran's nuclear facilities.Ratcliffe's statement said the CIA's information included ""new intelligence from an historically reliable and accurate source/method that several key Iranian nuclear facilities were destroyed and would have to be rebuilt over the course of years.""If the Iranians chose to rebuild, they would have to rebuild all three facilities (Natanz, Fordo, Esfahan) entirely, which would likely take years to do,"" she wrote on X.The US operation involved 125 military aircraft, targeting the three main Iranian nuclear facilities on Saturday.Ratcliffe's statement said the CIA's information included ""new intelligence from an historically reliable and accurate source/method that several key Iranian nuclear facilities were destroyed and would have to be rebuilt over the course of years.""",Negative
"The virtually abandoned Florida airport being turned into 'Alligator Alcatraz' Surrounded by alligator infested swamps, BBC Mundo visited the site forming part of the Trump administration's mass deportation agenda.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwyrnrnxy7yo,"– A convoy of trucks carrying tents, construction materials, and portable toilets flows into a virtually abandoned airport in Florida's picturesque Everglades, a UNESCO World Heritage Site.But they're not helping build the region's next big tourist attraction.The airfield where the detention center will be based is mainly a pilot training runway surrounded by vast swamps.In the stifling summer heat rife with mosquitoes, we managed to advance only a few meters into the compound when, as expected, a guard in a lorry blocked our way.We hear sounds coming from a small canal next to the compound.Although the airstrip belongs to Miami-Dade County, the decision to turn it into a detention center was made following a 2023 executive order by Republican Governor Ron DeSantis, invoking emergency powers to stem the flow of undocumented migrants.The new center, which according to authorities will have the capacity to accommodate around 1,000 detainees and will begin operations in July or August, is quickly becoming a controversial symbol of the Trump administration's immigration policy.As Trump orders immigration authorities to carry out ""the single largest mass deportation program in history"", human rights organisations say detention centers are becoming overcrowded.According to data obtained by CBS News, Immigration and Customs Enforcement has a record 59,000 detainees nationwide, 140% above its capacity.The ACLU of Florida told the BBC the proposed facility ""is not just cruel and absurd. It underscores how our immigration system is increasingly being used to punish people rather than process them.""",Negative

"RFK Jr's vaccine panel to review long-approved jabs for children Health experts have concerns about the new panel, which helps determine who gets vaccines in the US and when.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cj4en5wjr2vo,"– Robert F Kennedy Jr.'s panel of vaccine advisers will review long-approved vaccination schedules for children and teens.The seven members of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (Acip) met for the first time on Wednesday, weeks after Kennedy ousted all 17 of their predecessors.The Acip recommends who should be vaccinated and when to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).Although the appointees to ACIP have scientific credentials, many do not have significant experience studying microbiology, epidemiology or immunology,"" he wrote.The panel was initially meant to vote on recommendations for shots against RSV, a respiratory virus that can be dangerous for infants, but that has been postponed.The seven members of the Acip met for the first time on Wednesday, weeks after Kennedy ousted all 17 of their predecessors.The decision for the panel to discuss thimerosal, a mercury-based preservative that has not been used in most vaccines for decades, is perplexing, Dr Hanage said.The panel was initially meant to vote on recommendations for shots against RSV, a respiratory virus that can be dangerous for infants, but that has been postponed.",Negative
How Zohran Mamdani stunned New Yorkers with mayoral primary victory Cuomo and other Democrats had mocked Mamdani's policies - free public buses and city-run grocery stores - as unrealistic.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c75r7r07ndno,"– The big loser of the night wasn't his main opponent, former governor Andrew Cuomo, he said, but the US Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, who represents the Democratic Party establishment.It takes only a quick scroll through 33-year-old Mamdani's social media accounts to understand just how different his style is from that of a traditional politician, rejecting typical soundbites for a more unrehearsed feel.After he won the New York Democratic primary on Tuesday, that playbook is getting accolades for its ability to attract a large coalition.Who is Zohran Mamdani?Left-wing Democrat stuns former governor in NY mayor primaryThis is a wakeup call for the Democratic Party, said pollster Frank Luntz.The current New York mayor, Eric Adams—far from Mamdani's biggest fan—said earlier in June: ""I don't agree with his stance on many things, but I respect the fact he's true to who he is.""I was blown away by his personable skills with the way he talks to people and the way he can relate to just the average person and the way he humanises the voters that felt very frustrated with the way things were going,"" Mr Krizmanich told the BBC.Mamdani's win, however, perhaps sensing a greater threat, Adams—who is running for mayor as an independent in November—called him a ""snake oil salesman.""We've seen a Democratic Party establishment that has actively worked to undermine and defeat some of our best and brightest and most charismatic for ideological reasons.Voters want to believe that you're going to fight for them.""Mamdani's appeal across the wealth divide—he polled worst among lower-income residents, at 38% to Cuomo's 49%.",Positive
'I can see it's upsetting' - Trump asks BBC Ukrainian reporter about her family The US president asks Myroslava Petsa about her husband on the frontline after she asks him about supplying air defences to Ukraine.,https://www.bbc.com/news/videos/crl0x0y0ew3o,"– President Trump took a question from Myroslava Petsa from the BBC Ukrainian Service. She asked whether the US would be supplying Patriot air defense systems to Ukraine, to which she said yes. Trump then asked where she was from and took an interest in her personal situation, asking whether her husband was a soldier in Ukraine, to which she said yes. ""I wish you a lot of luck, I can see this is very upsetting to you and say hello to your husband,"" he concluded.

Thailand's 'weed wild west' faces new rules as smuggling to UK rises A number of British travellers have been arrested and prices have collapsed due to overproduction.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c056l0dgg8jo,"– ""When there is a weed shop on every corner, when people are smoking as they're walking down the street, when tourists are getting high on our beaches, other countries being affected by our laws, with people shipping it illegally—these are negatives."" He argues that the proposed new public health ministry regulations will supply and demand, and restore the industry to what it was always intended to be, focused solely on the medical use of marijuana.There is plenty of opposition to this notion from cannabis enthusiasts who believe the new rules will do nothing to curb smuggling or unlicensed glut.The legalisation of marijuana in 2022 was supposed to be followed by the passing of a new regulatory framework by the Thai parliament. But this never happened, partly, because of obstruction by vested interests with links to the marijuana industry.The public health minister has also said that consumption of marijuana will be criminalized again, although it's unclear when that could happen.Ever since the drug was decriminalized in 2022, there has been a frenzy of investment.There has been talk of restricting the industry before.",Negative
Ticket resellers employ overseas workers to bulk-buy,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c04e9k1vllro,"– Ticket touts are employing teams of workers to bulk-buy tickets for the UK's biggest concerts like Oasis and Taylor Swift so they can be resold for profit, a BBC investigation has found.We uncovered some touts are making ""millions"" hiring people overseas, known as ""ticket pullers"", with one telling an undercover journalist his team bought hundreds of tickets for Swift's Eras tour last year.The UK government plans new legislation to crack down on touts but critics argue it does not go far enough.The BBC's The Great Ticket Rip Off program this was the equivalent of ""100,000 people all of a sudden turning up and pushing in front of you in the queue.""If you are a ticketing company and an authorized resale company, and someone decides to list hundreds of tickets for a high-demand event... my question would be, where did you get the tickets? There's no due diligence.""Fans are usually limited to a handful of tickets when buying from primary platforms such as Ticketmaster.Touts often list their tickets on resale websites and one former Viagogo employee alleged he had seen some profiles with thousands of tickets for sale.We found genuine fans missed out or, in desperation, ended up paying way over the odds as touts have an army of people working for them to buy tickets for the most in-demand events as soon as they go on sale.The UK government plans new legislation to crack down on touts but critics argue it does not go far enough.",Negative
Controversial project to create artificial human DNA begins,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c6256wpn97ro,"– Scientists are working on a controversial project to create the building blocks of human life from scratch, in what is believed to be a world first.The research has been taboo until now because of concerns it could lead to designer babies or unforeseen changes for future generations.But now the World's largest medical charity, the Wellcome Trust, has given an initial £10m to start the project and says it has the potential to do more good than harm by accelerating treatments for many incurable diseases.Building DNA from scratch allows us to test out how DNA really works and test out new theories, because currently we can only really do that by tweaking DNA in DNA that already exists in living systems.""This technology is going to be developed one day, so by doing it now we are at least trying to do it in as responsible a way as possible and to confront the ethical and moral questions in an upfront way as possible,"" he told BBC News.",Positive
