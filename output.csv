But they are daughters of God,"" he wrote in Hope.Pope Francis roundly condemned countries that consider homosexuality a crime, and he talked of divorce sometimes being ""morally necessary"", citing cases of domestic abuse.However, there are those who suggest the Pope could have gone further to encourage change in Church teaching.Homosexual ""acts"" remain a sin in Catholicism, marriage can still only be between a man and a woman, divorce is still not officially recognized and the Pope himself remained very firmly against gender reassignment and surrogacy.Throughout his papacy, and long before that, Pope Francis also always remained firm in his own belief that women should not be priests.One of his first acts as pope was to give up the papal apartment on the third floor of the Apostolic Palace, instead choosing to live in the same guesthouse in which he had stayed as a cardinal.Some saw this as a sign he was giving up the ostentatious trappings of papacy, and of the humility he would certainly become known for—he had, after all, taken the name of a saint who championed the cause of the poor.But the Pope appeared to want the Church to explore and understand people's every day struggles in a fresh light.He acknowledged his own journey in seeing things differently to the way he had done in the past.Pope Francis also always remained firm in his own belief that women should not be priests.",Negative
