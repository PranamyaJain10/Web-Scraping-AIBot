'Humans are all they know' - Fate of whales uncertain as marine zoo shuts,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clyvexpew8zo,"– Wikie, 23, and her 11-year-old son Keijo. Killer whales are highly social animals, as social as we [humans] are, and they depend on social bonds. Wikie and Keijo could then use the large expanse of water, with human support from vets and welfare workers, until the end of their lives.The average lifespan of a male killer whale is about 30 years, according to the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration agency.Most experts agree that releasing the two whales, which are Icelandic orcas specifically, into the wild would not be suitable as both were born in captivity and would not have the skills to survive.Last month Marineland Antibes, located near Cannes in the French Riviera, said it would permanently shut on 5 January following new animal welfare laws.The legislation, which bans the use of dolphins and whales in marine zoo shows, was passed in 2021 but comes into effect next year.Marineland, which describes itself as the largest of its kind in Europe, currently keeps two killer whales—Wikie, 23, and her 11-year-old son Keijo.Wikie and Keijo, he was born in the wild and was able to relearn some of the necessary survival skills while living in the bay for four years.Another option is to send them to a Spanish marine zoo in the Canary Islands.Loro Parque, in Tenerife, complies with European animal welfare standards but campaigners fear Wikie and Keijo will still be made to perform there.It would be devastating for Wikie and Keijo to end up in another entertainment venue like Loro Parque—from one whale jail to another.""It's a bit like taking your dog out of the house and sending him into the woods to live freely as a wolf,"" says Hanne Strager.",Negative
