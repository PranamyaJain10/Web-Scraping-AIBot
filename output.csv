What we know about Kilmar Abrego Garcia and MS-13 allegations BBC Verify looks at the evidence behind allegations that the Salvadoran mistakenly deported to a mega-prison was a dangerous gang member.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1k4072e3nno,"– The case of Kilmar Abrego Garcia—a 29-year-old from El Salvador who was deported from the US in March—has prompted a legal showdown over the administration's immigration policy.Judges all the way up to the US Supreme Court have ruled that Mr Abrego Garcia was deported in error and that the US government should help ""facilitate"" his return to his home in Maryland.But the White House has accused Mr Abrego Garcia of being a member of the transnational Salvadorian gang MS-13, a designated foreign terrorist organization, saying that he will ""will never live"" in the US again.Mr Abrego Garcia denies he is a member of the gang and he has not been convicted of any crime.Mr Abrego Garcia's lawyers say that he was granted the status based on his ""well-founded"" fear of persecution by Barrio-18, the main rival gang of MS-13.Judges all the way up to the US Supreme Court have ruled that Mr Abrego Garcia was deported in error and that the US government should help ""facilitate"" his return to his home in Maryland.Mr Abrego Garcia has never been convicted of any criminal offense, including gang membership, in the US or in El Salvador.Mr Abrego Garcia was detained along with three other people in Hyattsville, Maryland, in the car park of a Home Depot.Officers at the Prince George's County Police Department said the men were ""loitering"" and subsequently identified Mr Abrego Garcia and two of the others as members of MS-13.Mr Abrego Garcia was wearing a ""Chicago Bulls hat and a hoodie with rolls of money covering the eyes, ears and mouth of the presidents on the separate denominations.""Officers claimed the clothing was ""indicative of the Hispanic gang culture"" and that ""wearing the Chicago Bulls hat represents thay (sic)""",Negative
"Could JD Vance meet the most famous Catholic of them all? The US vice-president will meet Italy's prime minister but an audience at the Vatican could also happen, the BBC learns.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cdxn21l37d7o,"– The White House and the vice-president's office did not respond to questions from the BBC about Vance's trip, and the Vatican has not confirmed any formal or informal meeting with Vance's trip, said a source familiar with his thinking.It could also signal a thaw in relations between the Vatican and Washington after months of tension over issues such as moral leadership and migration, with the Pope having previously said that mass deportations of people fleeing poverty or persecution damaged ""the dignity of many men and women, and of entire families.""A photo with Pope Francis would be a major win for JD Vance, and it would also reflect Pope Francis' inclusive approach - his willingness to welcome and meet anyone, even those with differing visions or values,"" said David Gibson, director of the Center on Religion and Culture at Fordham University, the Jesuit university of New York.Vance's visit is the first to Europe since he delivered an ideological broadside against European leaders at the Munich Security Conference in February.He accused them of abandoning free speech, caving in to political correctness and losing touch with their citizens on issues like migration and national identity.That friction with the leaders on the continent also extends to the Vatican, where relations with the Trump administration have been strained by hardline immigration policies which have faced pushback from Catholic leaders and Pope Francis.Cuts to refugee programs, the prospect of large-scale deportation plans, arrests in places of worship, and efforts to curb birthright citizenship have been condemned by the US bishops' conference as being contrary to the common good.Pope Francis himself urged a more compassionate response to migration, drawing on Gospel teachings and the parable of the Good Samaritan.",Positive
Menendez brothers' resentencing bid delayed after contentious day in court A hearing set to decide the fate of the convicted killers was delayed after bickering in court.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c74n0lppp5ko,"– A highly anticipated resentencing hearing for convicted killers Erik and Lyle Menendez kicked off on Thursday before unravelling and being postponed by a judge.The brothers themselves appeared in court via a video feed from a San Diego prison, wearing identical cobalt blue prison uniforms.But the hearing was derailed by a development in another bid they've been chasing for freedom: Clemency from California Gov Gavin Newsom.Newsom had ordered the state's parole board to examine the case, and that panel completed a risk assessment report this week.The brothers were convicted in the 1989 killing of their parents in a Beverly Hills mansion - a case that continues to divide the nation.The hearing devolved from the start as attorneys for the brothers fought with prosecutors, who oppose their release.Mr Geragos has also asked Judge Michael Jesic of the Superior Court of Los Angeles to reduce their conviction to manslaughter, which could pave the way to a faster release.The brothers' attorney Mark Geragos declared he would seek the recusal of the Los Angeles County District Attorney's Office from the case and prosecutors asked the court to review a new report about whether the brothers could be a danger to the public if released.The brothers themselves appeared in court via a video feed from a San Diego prison, wearing identical cobalt blue prison uniforms.Mr Geragos intends to file to recuse the district attorney's office from the case.Mr Geragos and a lawyer representing the Menendez family members, Bryan Freedman, have accused Los Angeles County District Attorney Nathan Hochman of bias and violating the family's rights.""This is a DA who made up his mind and did no hard work in terms of his position,"" Mr Geragos said after the hearing.The brothers have spent over 30 years in prison for murdering their parents with a series of shotgun blasts.",Negative
"Trump and Meloni talk up chances of US trade deal with Europe ""There will be a trade deal, 100%,"" Trump said, while Meloni said she was ""sure"" they could reach agreement.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cdjlr3mnlero,"– Donald Trump and Giorgia Meloni talked up the chances of a trade deal between the US and Europe, as the Italian prime minister visited Washington.""There will be a trade deal, 100%,"" Trump said, ""but it will be a fair deal"", while Meloni said she was ""sure"" they could reach an agreement, later adding that her aim was to ""make the West great again.""Meloni is the first European leader to visit Washington since Trump imposed, then paused, 20% tariffs on imports from the bloc.The pair enjoy a good relationship and the Italian leader hopes to position herself as a bridge between the EU and the US amid fractured relations and mounting concerns about the global impact of Trump's tariffs.At a press conference on Thursday following their conversation, the leaders said they had discussed defense spending, immigration, and tariffs.The atmosphere in the Oval Office appeared relaxed and good-natured - similar to the reception UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer received during his visit to the White House in February.However Meloni's aides had described the visit as a ""commercial peace mission"" following Trump's decision to impose a 10% baseline tariff on almost all foreign imports to the US.Meloni previously called the tariffs ""absolutely wrong"" and said they would end up damaging the EU ""as much as the US.""While she didn't score any tangible wins on tariffs during the meeting, she did convince Trump to accept an invitation to visit Rome, which she said would be an occasion for him to meet other European leaders.",Positive
Trump's tariffs leave China's neighbours with an impossible choice Ambitious economies like Vietnam and Indonesia are stuck between China and the US as the trade war escalates.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0455k6g71eo,"– Chinese President Xi Jinping has been visiting Vietnam, Malaysia and Cambodia this week, urging unity against Trump's tariffs.The trip was long planned but has fresh urgency given how significant South East Asia is to the Chinese economy.Trump tariffs in 2016 sent a glut of cheap Chinese imports, originally intended for the US, into South East Asia, hurting many local manufacturers.But they also opened new doors for other businesses, often into global supply chains that wanted to cut their dependence on China.Trump may have hit pause on these tariffs but ""the damage is done,"" says Doris Liew, an economist at Malaysia's Institute for Democracy and Economic Affairs.""This serves as a wake-up call for the region, not only to reduce reliance on the US, but also to re-balance overdependence on any single trade and export partner.""It's a role that South East Asia's export-driven economies have played well - they have benefitted from both Chinese and US trade and investment.But Trump's paused levies could derail that.China earned a record $3.5tn from exports in 2024 - 16% of its exports go to South East Asia, making it the biggest market.China's trade minister Tengku Zafrul Aziz told the BBC on Tuesday, ahead of Xi's visit.""We will tell the US government that Thailand is not only an exporter but also an ally and economic partner that the US can rely on in the long term,"" Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra said.",Neutral
"Man used police officer mum's gun to kill two at Florida college, police say The 20-year-old alleged gunman began shooting at around lunchtime near the student union building.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvgq7l32r98o,"– The son of a police officer has opened fire with her former service weapon at Florida State University (FSU), killing two people and injuring six others, authorities say. The alleged gunman, 20-year-old FSU student Phoenix Ikner, began shooting at around lunchtime near the student union building in the state capital of Tallahassee. The suspect was shot by police and taken to hospital. The deceased were not students, campus police said, but their identities have not been released. President Trump, who said he was briefed on the incident before meeting Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni at the White House, was asked whether he wanted to change gun regulations in light of the shooting.He said he was a ""big advocate"" of the Second Amendment in the US Constitution, which protects gun rights.""I have been since the beginning,"" he said. He called the shooting ""a shame, a horrible thing.""This is not the first shooting at FSU.",Negative
Scientists find 'strongest evidence yet' of life on distant planet,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c39jj9vkr34o,"– Scientists have found new but tentative evidence that a faraway world orbiting another star may be home to life.A Cambridge team studying the atmosphere of a planet called K2-18b has detected signs of sigma molecules which on Earth are only produced by simple organisms.This is the second, and more promising, time chemicals associated with life have been detected in the planet's atmosphere by Nasa's James Webb Space Telescope (JWST).But the team and independent astronomers stress that more data is needed to confirm these results.The lead researcher, Prof Nikku Madhusudhan, told me at his lab at Cambridge University's Institute of Astronomy that he hopes to obtain the clinching evidence soon.""This is the strongest evidence yet there is possibly life out there.I can realistically say that we can confirm this signal within one to two years.""If we confirm that there is life on K2-18b, it should basically confirm that life is very common in the galaxy.""The reason many researchers infer that the planet has a vast liquid ocean is the absence of the gas ammonia in K2-18b's atmosphere.The Cambridge group has found that the atmosphere seems to contain the chemical signature of at least one of two molecules that are associated with life: dimethyl sulphide (DMDS) and dimethyl ammoniaulphide (DMDS).On Earth, these gases are produced by marine phytoplankton and bacteria.Prof Madhusudhan said he was surprised by how much gas was apparently detected during a single observation window.""The amount we estimate of this gas in the atmosphere is thousands of times higher than what we have on Earth,"" he said.""So, if the association with life is real, then this planet will be teeming with life.""Even with that certainty, there is still the question of what is the origin of this gas,"" she told BBC News.",Positive
Hamas formally rejects Israeli ceasefire offer,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ce8gzm0p1y8o,"– Israel's latest ceasefire offer involved a 45-day ceasefire in return for the release of 10 hostages. Hamas has formally rejected Israel's latest ceasefire offer, saying it is prepared to immediately negotiate a deal that would see the release of all remaining hostages in return for an end to the war and the release of Palestinian prisoners.In a video statement, Hamas' chief negotiator, Khalil al-Hayya, said: ""We will not accept partial deals that serve [Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin] Netanyahu's political agenda.""Fifty-nine hostages remain in captivity and 24 are thought to be alive.Hamas has previously said it would contemplate an overall deal to end the war but the two sides are nowhere near any kind of agreement that would bring that about.Israel's stated aim is the complete disarmament and destruction of Hamas.The latest series of Israeli strikes killed at least 37 people, the majority of them displaced civilians living in a tented camp, according to Gaza's Hamas-run civil defense agency.Witnesses in al-Mawasi said dozens of Palestinians including children had died after tents were set ablaze following a ""powerful explosion.""I rushed outside and saw the tent next to mine engulfed in flames,"" a man told the BBC's Gaza Lifeline program.The Israeli military did not immediately comment but said that it was looking into reports of the strikes.Israel has previously told Palestinians to evacuate from other parts of Gaza to al-Mawasi.Hamas has previously said it would contemplate an overall deal to end the war but the two sides are nowhere near any kind of agreement that would bring that about.Israel's stated aim is the complete disarmament and destruction of Hamas.",Negative
