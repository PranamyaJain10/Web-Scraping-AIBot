Moment of big opportunity and high risk for Marine Le Pen Backing the collapse of Michel Barnier's French government is a high-stakes gamble for the far right leader.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c86w9n705z8o,"– Marine Le Pen has long sought to ""normalise"" National Rally (RN) in the eyes of the French people, rebranding it six years ago from her father's old National Front.Jump back a few months to France's snap parliamentary elections when RN came first with 32% of the vote.Now in the dying days of 2024, she is taking a gamble on whether French voters will see her as acting in the national interest in bringing down a weakened government because she objects to its 2025 budget that aims to bring down France's budget deficit from 6% of national output, or GDP.Le Pen's argument is that Barnier didn't include enough of her demands in his budget, while Barnier said his budget wasn't ""aimed to please""—and he accused her of ""trying to get into a kind of bidding war"" during their negotiations.The RN leader could end up plunging France ""into the great political and financial unknown,"" in the words of Le Figaro deputy editor Vincent Trémolet de Villers.She won't want to be labelled as the politician who pushed France into economic turbulence when in her eyes it is Macron who is to blame for France's economic state.Recent polls suggest at least 62% of the electorate think the president should resign if the Barnier government falls.Le Pen's adviser Philippe Olivier told Le Monde the president was ""a fallen republican monarch, advancing with his shirt open and a rope around his neck up to the next dissolution [of parliament].""What is obvious is that it's not about Barnier... it's about her trying to overthrow and weaken Macron, obviously for her personal ambitions to herself become the next president,"" says Prof Armin Steinbach of HEC business school in Paris.",Negative

UK Security Minister Dan Jarvis said the operation ""exposed Russian kleptocrats, drug gangs and cyber criminals - all of whom relied on the flow of dirty money.""",Negative
