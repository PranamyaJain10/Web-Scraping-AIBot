Russia's summer push in Ukraine targets three fronts but faces stern resistance Analysis of Russia's advance in northern and eastern Ukraine in maps.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c70rl6lk2yxo,"– Russia's aim in eastern Ukraine appears to be to create ""a cauldron"", semi-encircling the Ukrainians around Pokrovsk and Kostyantynivka and then forcing them to retreat. Russian troops are now trying to wedge into the area between these two cities to create ""a bridgehead from where they can attack Pokrovsk or Kostyantynivka"", says Maj Viktor Trehubov, a spokesman for the Khortytsya operational-strategic group, which co-ordinates forces in eastern Ukraine. military officials deny these claims, saying that a small group of Russian soldiers entered a village in the Dnipropetrovsk region to take photos with a Russian flag but were quickly ""eliminated."" Military observers believe these operations are aimed at forcing Ukraine to spread its forces too thin along the entire 1,200-km long front line, so that they divert troops from key areas.One of those frontline areas is Pokrovsk, a strategic hub in eastern Ukraine, which Moscow has been trying to capture for more than two years. Military observers believe these operations are aimed at forcing Ukraine to spread its forces too thin along the entire 1,200-km long front line, so that they divert troops from key areas.Last month Russian forces seized 556 sq km (215 sq miles), its biggest land grab this year, according to the open-source DeepState monitoring website in Ukraine.",Negative

'I can't drink the water' - life next to a US data centre Residents in rural Georgia say the data centre next door has disrupted their water supply.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy8gy7lv448o,"– When Beverly Morris retired in 2016, she thought she had found her dream home—a peaceful stretch of rural Georgia, surrounded by trees and quiet.Today, it's anything but.Just 400 yards (366m) from her front porch in Fayette County sits a large, windowless building filled with servers, cables, and blinking lights.It's a data center—one of many popping up across small-town America, and around the globe, to power everything from online banking to artificial intelligence tools like ChatGPT.""I can't live in my home with half of my home functioning and no water,"" Ms Morris says.She believes the construction of the center, which is owned by Meta (the parent company of Facebook), disrupted her private well, causing an excessive build-up of sediment.Ms Morris now hauls water in buckets to flush her toilet.She says she had to fix the plumbing in her kitchen to restore water pressure.But the water that comes of the tap still has residue in it.""I'm afraid to drink the water, but I still cook with it, and brush my teeth with it,"" says Morris.Meta, however, says the two aren't connected.The company commissioned an independent groundwater study to investigate Morris' concerns.While Meta disputes that it has caused the problems with Ms Morris' water, there's no doubt, in her estimation, that the company has worn out its welcome as her neighbor.""Our goal is that by 2030, we'll be putting more water back into the watersheds and communities where we're operating data centers, than we're taking out,"" says Will Hewes, global water stewardship lead at Amazon Web Services (AWS), which runs more data centers than any other company globally.",Negative

'Huge wall of water': Texas man stood on meter box to survive deadly floods,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3358pz41d6o,"– When Christian Fell saw floodwater beginning to fill his home in Hunt, Texas, last Friday, it was already too late.

Greg Abbott said authorities had issued a storm warning and knew about a possible flash flood, but ""didn't know the magnitude of the storm.""But as we get further and further out from the disaster itself, then our confidence that we're still going to find survivors goes down very rapidly.""",Negative
"US sanctions UN expert Francesca Albanese, critic of Israel's Gaza offensive",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c70rllxr0kyo,"– The Trump administration is imposing sanctions on the UN Human Rights Council special rapporteur Francesca Albanese, an outspoken critic of Israel's military offensive in Gaza. Secretary of State Marco Rubio linked the move to her support for the International Criminal Court (ICC), some of whose judges have already been sanctioned by the US.Albanese declined to comment to the BBC, but was quoted by Al Jazeera as describing the sanctions as ""mafia style intimidation techniques.""The US took the action after the court last year issued arrest warrants for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his then-Defense Minister Yoav Gallant for alleged war crimes in Gaza, accusations they reject.Rubio said Albanese had shown contempt for the US by writing ""threatening letters"" to several US companies, making what he called unfounded accusations and recommending the ICC prosecutions of the companies and their executives.Albanese has criticized Donald Trump's plan, announced in February, to take over the Gaza Strip and displace its residents elsewhere.""It's unlawful, immoral and... completely irresponsible because it will make the regional crisis even worse,"" she said in February.Albanese has long argued that Western governments are not doing enough to support the rights of Palestinians in the occupied Palestinian territories.Her outspoken stance has attracted significant support among those who accuse Israeli and US leaders of weaponising accusations of antisemitism in order to silence scrutiny of their policies.Earlier this month Albanese called on dozens of multinational companies to stop doing business with Israel, warning them they risked being complicit in war crimes in Gaza and the occupied West Bank.",Negative
