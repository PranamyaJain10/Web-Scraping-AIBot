Dominique Pelicot's double life: Who is the man who plotted his wife's mass rape?,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clynx2q93q1o,"– It was something in Dominique Pelicot's swagger, his ""élan""—as the French might put it—that immediately struck the psychiatrist as odd.Dr Layet had never come across anyone quite like this grey-haired former electrician, calmly awaiting prosecution for drugging his wife Gisele and inviting dozens of strangers to rape her as she lay, unconscious, in the couple's bedroom.In court, years later, after two long prison interviews with Pelicot and with more than 20 of the other accused, Dr Layet presented a more detailed assessment to the panel of judges.A measured and eloquent expert witness, Dr Layet stressed that Pelicot exhibited no signs of severe mental illness.But what are we to make of this jowly, grey-haired figure, with his black cane and scarf, seated in a glass cage; this serial rapist whose cruelty has almost been eclipsed in the public imagination by the dignity and courage shown by his former wife?Dr Layet first encountered Dominique in the late summer of 2020 at a police station in the nearby town of Carpentras, immediately after his arrest for filming with a camera up women's skirts in a local supermarket.Asked in court to explain that 'other' Pelicot, Dr Layet said that he had detected a range of emotional and sexual abnormalities.They are, perhaps, most neatly captured in their original French, in a prosecution document seen by the BBC.A fitting metaphor, given that Pelicot had stored video evidence of his crimes on a computer memory card.",Negative
