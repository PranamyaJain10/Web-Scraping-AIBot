"Ex-Bangladesh leader authorised deadly crackdown, leaked audio suggests Sheikh Hasina authorised lethal force against protesters, according to leaked audio verified by the BBC.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn4l1z5qd1vo,"– A deadly crackdown on student-led protests in Bangladesh last year was authorized by then prime minister Sheikh Hasina, according to audio of one of her phone calls verified by BBC Eye.In the audio, which was leaked online in March, Hasina says she authorized her security forces to ""use lethal weapons"" against protesters and that ""wherever they find [them], they will shoot.""Prosecutors in Bangladesh plan to use the recording as crucial evidence against Hasina, who is being tried in absentia at a special tribunal for crimes against humanity.Up to 1,400 people died in last summer's unrest, according to UN investigators.The leaked audio of Hasina's conversation with an unidentified senior government official is the most significant evidence yet that she gave direct authorisation to shoot anti-government protesters, tens of thousands of whom had taken to the streets by last summer.The protests began against civil service job quotas for relatives of those who fought in the 1971 war of independence and escalated into a mass movement that ousted Hasina, who had been in power for 15 years.The BBC investigation established previously unreported details about a police massacre of protesters in the capital—including a much higher death toll.",Negative
"'Lives are at stake:' Deadly Texas storms put spotlight on Trump's weather agency cuts While experts say the weather agency performed well, they warn it is operating far below staffing needs.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx23ye0xnnyo,"– Experts say the National Weather Service issued alerts in a timely manner over the weekend, the deadly incident carries warnings about what could happen if the NWS and NOAA are not properly staffed and funded in the future.""The Weather Service did a good job with the information you had here. I don't think the staffing cuts contributed to this,"" said Andy Hazelton, a climate scientist who was laid off from NOAA where he modelled hurricane paths.But this is the kind of event we can see more of if the cuts to NOAA continue, if you make the models worse or have the staffing levels lower,"" said Tom Fahy, legislative director of the National Weather Service Employees Organization.The San Antonio office, which played a leading role in forecasting last week's deadly rainstorms, has about an 18% vacancy rate, according to a tally of open roles on its website.The volunteer pointed to one notable exit: Paul Yura, a warning coordination meteorologist who took the Trump administration's early retirement offer in April, according to local media.The proposed budget states that, ""NWS continues to produce operational forecasts, warnings, impact-based decision support services and other life-saving products and services to the emergency management community and public as they prepare for and respond to increasingly frequent severe weather and water events.""He was our mentor, he was our guy we would talk to,"" the volunteer said, explaining that without Mr Yura, volunteers did not have a point person during emergencies like the 4 July floods.",Negative

Netanyahu arrived at the White House shortly after 17:00 EST (21:00 GMT) on Tuesday for the meeting, which was not open to members of the press.Before discussions resumed on Tuesday, a Palestinian source familiar with the talks told the BBC they have not made any headway.The latest round of negotiations between Hamas and Israel began on Sunday.Trump told reporters on Monday evening that ceasefire talks are ""going very well.""But Qatar, which has played a mediator role in negotiations, said on Tuesday morning that more time was needed for negotiations.Trump's Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff later said that Israel and Hamas were closing the gap on issues that previously prevented them from reaching a deal, and that he hoped a temporary, 60-day ceasefire will be agreed on this week.The ongoing Gaza war began on 7 October 2023 when Hamas attacked Israel, killing 1,200 people and taking 251 hostages, according to Israeli figures.Before the Israeli Prime Minister's meeting with Trump on Monday, a Qatari delegation arrived at the White House and spoke with officials for several hours, Axios reported, citing a source with knowledge of the talks.Trump told reporters on Monday evening that ceasefire talks are ""going very well.""We still have to finish the job in Gaza, release all our hostages, eliminate and destroy Hamas' military and government capabilities,"" Netanyahu said.",Negative
"Russian minister's death serves as warning to political elite President Putin sacked his transport minister. Hours later, his body was found in a park with a gunshot wound to the head.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0l49310z2go,"– It was a dramatic start to the week in Russia.On Monday morning, President Vladimir Putin sacked his transport minister, Roman Starovoit.By the afternoon Starovoit was dead; his body was discovered in a park on the edge of Moscow with a gunshot wound to the head.Investigators said they presumed the former minister had taken his own life.In the tabloid Moskovsky Komsomolets this morning there was a sense of shock.""The suicide of Roman Starovoit just hours after the president's order to sack him is an almost unique occurrence in Russian history,"" the paper declared.Unlike before, when you could get these jobs, get rich, get promoted from regional level to federal level, today, that is clearly not a career path if you want to stay alive,"" says Nina Khrushcheva, professor of International Affairs at the New School in New York.""He must have feared that he would receive tens of years in prison if he was going to be under investigation, and that his family would suffer tremendously.So, there's no way out.I immediately thought of Sergo Ordzhonikidze, one of Stalin's ministers, who [killed himself] in 1937 because he felt there was no way out.Roman Starovoit's death may have made headlines in the papers here.But this ""almost unique occurrence in Russian history"" has received minimal coverage on state TV.Unlike before, when you could get these jobs, get these jobs, get rich, get promoted from regional level to federal level, today, that is clearly not a career path if you want to stay alive.",Negative
"After Diddy: Why hip-hop is still struggling to have its own 'MeToo' moment The Combs verdict in itself is unlikely to lead to wider changes in the industry, according to insiders",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5yllvjgpk6o,"– Sean ""Diddy"" Combs was in the kitchen of his Beverly Hills estate with his assistant Capricorn Clark.Turning to her, he issued a string of commands: ""Sit down, stand up, turn around, walk over there, hand me that. Now go back."" His girlfriend obeyed his every word.""Did you see that?"" said Combs to his assistant. ""You won't do that. That's why you don't have a man like me.""This account, shared by Ms Clark (also known as Cassie) in her testimony during Combs' recent eight-week trial, gave a glimpse into his dynamic with his partner - and a sense of what was happening behind closed doors.Ms Ventura, an R&B singer who was previously signed to his record label, testified that throughout their long-term relationship, Combs—who was 17 years her senior—beat her, blackmailed her and coerced her into drug-fuelled sex sessions with escorts.Last week, he was found guilty on two counts of transportation to engage in prostitution.But now, campaigners, survivors of sexual violence and insiders within the music industry are asking: Why did it take so long to hold Combs accountable?And, in light of Hollywood's MeToo movement that uncovered and helped root out sexual harassment and abuse in the film industry, and which began nearly a decade ago - is it now time that the music industry, or more specifically, hip-hop, had a MeToo movement of its own?",Negative
"Trump delays tariffs as the rest of the world plays hardball The US president reveals his poker ""tell"" by showing he is open to delays to secure trade deals.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c628nk51364o,"– Donald Trump's White House had grandly promised ""90 deals in 90 days"" after partially pausing the process of levying what the US president called ""reciprocal"" tariffs.In reality, there won't even be nine deals done by the time we reach Trump's first cut-off date on 9 July. Financial markets believe in rolling delays, in the idea of TACO, that Trump Always Chickens Out - although they may embolden foot-dragging on all sides that lead to a renewed crisis.However, the real takeaway here has been the Trump administration's inability to strike deals.The jaunty letters being sent from the US to its trading partners this week are simply a reincarnation of that infamous White House ""Liberation Day"" blue board.The US may be playing hardball, but so are most other nations.Japan and South Korea were singled out for the first two letters, which effectively further blow up their trade deals with the US.The Japanese have done little to hide their fury at the US approach.Its finance minister even hinted at using its ownership of the world's biggest stockpile of US government debt - basically the biggest banker of America's debts - as a source of potential leverage.The dynamic from April has not really changed.",Negative
Instagram wrongly accuses some users of breaching child sex abuse rules,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy8kjdz9nr3o,"– Instagram users have told the BBC of the ""extreme stress"" of having their accounts banned after being wrongly accused by the platform of breaching its rules on child sexual exploitation.The BBC has been in touch with three people who were told by parent company Meta that their accounts were being permanently disabled, only to have them reinstated shortly after their cases were highlighted to journalists.""I've lost endless hours of sleep, felt isolated. It's been horrible, not to mention having an accusation like that over my head,"" one of the men told BBC News. Meta declined to comment.The BBC raised David's case to Meta on 3 July, as one of a number of people who claimed to have been wrongly banned over child sexual exploitation.David found a Reddit thread, where many others were posting that they had also been wrongly banned over child sexual exploitation.""We have lost years of memories, in my case over 10 years of messages, photos, and posts - due to a completely outrageous and vile accusation,"" he told BBC News.Faisal said he remained upset over the incident, and is now worried the account ban might come up if any background checks are made on him.A third user Salim told BBC News that he also had accounts falsely banned for child sexual exploitation violations.He highlighted his case to journalists, stating that appeals are ""largely ignored"", business accounts were being affected, and AI was ""labelling ordinary people as criminal abusers.""It is a massive weight off my shoulders,"" said David.",Negative
"US will hike tariffs on copper to 50%, Trump says",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cjrljr8qv3zo,"– Copper entering the US from other countries is set to face a new tax of 50%, President Donald Trump has said.The decision carries through on tariff threats the president made earlier this year, when he ordered an investigation into how imports of the metal were affecting national security.Copper prices in the US jumped to a record high after the announcement of the new import tax, which Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said are expected to come into effect around the end of this month. Trump sent letters to leaders of 14 countries on Monday, including South Korea and Japan, warning them of plans to institute new levies ranging from 25% to 40%.Scott Lincicome, vice president of economics and trade at the Cato Institute, said the announcement seemed like ""more of the same"" - stirring uncertainty, while at the same time making it ""quite clear"" that higher tariffs of some sort were coming.""We're going to get some sort of new level of historically high US tariffs - we're really just wrangling over the exact number and coverage,"" he said, adding that the measure would help US producers but hurt the many more firms in the US that need copper as an input.The US imported about 810,000 metric tons of refined copper last year, about half of what it consumed, according to the US Geological Survey.",Negative
