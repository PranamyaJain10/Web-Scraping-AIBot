'Kicking butt' or 'going too fast'? Trump voters reflect on 100 days Five Trump supporters say his first 100 days have met their expectations - with a few surprises and some warning signs.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c807d4n0npeo,"– It's been 100 days since Donald Trump made a historic return to power earlier this year, it was with the help of voters who represented a diverse coalition of backgrounds—truck drivers, veterans, business owners and more.They represented a wide range of perspectives that helped explain Trump's enduring appeal. But 100 days after he took office, how do his staunchest supporters feel now?The BBC has returned to five of them. Luiz Oliveira says he ""can't keep up"" with the rapid policy changes Trump has made in his first 100 days.On immigration, he has appreciated the flurry of new border restrictions and the emphasis on deportations, including sending men to a notorious mega-prison in El Salvador.June Carey's opinion of Donald Trump has not changed, but the first few months of Trump's second term are not what she anticipated either.""He's a bit more aggressive and a little bit more erratic than I expected,"" the California artist says.Overall, he feels Trump has been more productive at the start of his second term.Trump's promise to impose tariffs and bring manufacturing jobs back to America was a key reason why Ben Maurer, a 39-year-old freight truck driver from Pennsylvania, voted for the president.He's a bit more aggressive and a little bit more erratic than I expected.""I'm a supporter, but at the end of the day, if this doesn't work, I'll say it's a mistake—he did things too fast, scared the markets, scared the economy.""Amanda Sue Mathis backed Trump in 2024 because she felt he was the best candidate to address America's most pressing problems—100 days in, she says he's made strong progress.She wants a ""merit-based society"" and praises Trump's rollback of Diversity, Equity and Inclusion policies which had tried to boost minority representation and tackle discrimination.",Positive
"Australia's universal healthcare is crumbling. Can it be saved? More and more Australians, regardless of where they live, are delaying or going without the care they need.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cnv56q82vnro,"– When Australia's modern health system was born four decades ago— underpinned by a public insurance scheme called Medicare—it was supposed to guarantee affordable and accessible high-quality care to people like Mrs Elliott as ""a basic right."" But the scheme essentially meant Australians could present their bright green Medicare member card at a doctor's office or hospital, and Canberra would be sent a bill.It paid through rebates funded by taxes.Patients would either receive ""bulk billed""—completely free—care, mostly through the emerging public system, or heavily subsidised treatment through a private healthcare sector offering more benefits and choice to those who wanted them.Health funding here is complex and shared between states and federal governments.But experts suspect the true figure is higher: it's skewed by seniors and children, who tend to visit doctors more often and still enjoy mostly bulk-billed appointments.Australians tell the BBC the country is at a crossroads, and needs to decide if universal healthcare is worth saving.Health has become a defining issue for voters ahead of the nation's election on 3 May, with both of Australia's major parties promising billions of dollars in additional funding.But experts say the solutions being offered up are band-aid fixes, while what is needed are sweeping changes to the way the system is funded—reform for which there has so far been a lack of political will.Australians tell the BBC the country is at a crossroads, and needs to decide if universal healthcare is worth saving.",Positive
"Judge says US citizen, 2, may have been deported without 'meaningful process' A federal judge said there was ""strong suspicion"" the Louisiana-born girl had been sent to Honduras with her mother and sister.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4g278yn4d3o,"– A federal judge says that a two-year-old US citizen may have been deported to Honduras with her mother and 11-year-old sister without due process amid the Trump administration's drive to ramp up deportations. In a court filing, Judge Terry Doughty said that there was ""strong suspicion"" that the child—identified only as VML—was deported ""with no meaningful process."" The Louisiana-born child and her family members were apprehended during a routine appointment at a New Orleans immigration office on 22 April, according to documents.A spokesperson for Department of Homeland Security said the mother wanted to take her children with her when she was sent to Honduras. According to the court documents, the judge had sought to arrange a phone call with the girl's mother, but was told by a government lawyer that it ""would not be possible because she (and presumably VML) had just been released in Honduras.""The immigration status of the girl's mother, father and sister remains unclear. The two-year-old, however, is a US citizen. ""It is illegal and unconstitutional to deport, detain for deportation, or recommend deportation of a US citizen,"" said the judge.A hearing has been scheduled for 19 May ""in the interest of dispelling our strong suspicion that the government just deported a US citizen with no meaningful process.""",Negative

Extraordinary photos from the funeral Leaders from around the world attend the funeral of Pope Francis as large crowds gather in Vatican City.,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/resources/idt-39ce9b35-2de1-45dd-a268-6d3f918e8500,"– Pope Francis was laid to rest in a simple wooden casket rather than the more elaborate ones used for previous papal burials made of three nesting coffins made of cypress, lead, and oak. An estimated 400,000 people lined the streets of Rome and gathered inside St Peter's Square for the funeral of Pope Francis in Vatican City, marking the culmination of days of mourning. World leaders and dignitaries from across the globe were among those in attendance. Francis died on Monday at the age of 88, just a day after he made his final public appearance to offer Easter greetings from a balcony at St Peter's Basilica. Francis adopted a markedly less formal tone than previous popes in his time as the leader of the Church, underlining his reputation for simplicity and humility. This simplicity was again evident in the wishes he had for proceedings following his death. After the funeral service, the Pope's coffin was carried in an armour-plated 'Popemobile' through crowd-lined streets, across the River Tiber and past the Colosseum towards the basilica of Santa Maria Maggiore, where Pope Francis requested to be buried. Pope Francis made his wishes for a simple burial clear in his will, saying: ""The tomb should be in the earth; simple, without special decoration, bearing only the inscription: Franciscus."" Authorities in Rome and the Vatican stepped up security measures this week to deal with the huge numbers flocking to say farewell to Pope Francis.",Negative
