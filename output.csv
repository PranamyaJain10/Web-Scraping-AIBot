The fierce battle over the 'Holy Grail' of shipwrecks Colombia and a US firm are fighting over a shipwreck in the Caribbean Sea that could be worth $18bn.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckgn18xl3j7o,"– It has been hailed as the most valuable shipwreck in the world.A Spanish galleon, the San José, was sunk by the British off the coast of Colombia more than 300 years ago.The Colombian and Spanish states have staked a claim to it, as have a US salvage company and indigenous groups in South America.There have been court battles in Colombia and the US, and the case is now before the Permanent Court of Arbitration at the Hague.The Colombian government says it wants to raise the remains of the vessel and put it in a museum. Treasure hunters point to the commercial value of the cargo, which could be as much as $18bn (£13.bn).But archaeologists say the wreck—and thousands like it scattered across the world—should be left where it is.The wreck lay on the seabed until the 1980s, when a US salvage company, Glocca Mora, said it had found it.It tried to persuade the Colombians to go into partnership to raise the treasure and split the proceeds, but the two sides could not agree on who should get what share, and plunged into a legal battle.In 2015, the Colombians said they had found the ship, independently of the information provided by the Americans, on a different part of the sea bed.The Spanish state has staked its claim, arguing that the San José and its cargo remains state property, and indigenous groups from Bolivia and Peru say they are entitled to at least a part of the booty.They argue that it is not Spanish treasure because it was plundered by the Spanish from mines in the Andes during the colonial period.The wreck lay on the seabed until the 1980s, when a US salvage company, Glocca Mora, now known as Sea Search Armada, said it had found it.It tried to persuade the Colombians to go into partnership to raise the treasure and split the proceeds, but the two sides could not agree on who should get what share, and plunged into a legal battle.",Negative
"Biden opposes Israeli strikes on Iran nuclear sites ""The answer is no,"" the US president said, adding any attack by Israel on Iran must be done ""proportionally"".",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx24d6ky5r7o,"– US President Joe Biden has said he does not support any potential Israeli retaliatory strike on Iranian nuclear sites after Iran launched around 180 missiles at Israel.Tensions are high between Iran and Israel after the Iranian attack on Tuesday, which Israel said was mostly repelled by its missile defense system.Iran said the barrage was a response to the killings of Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh, Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah and Iranian Revolutionary Guards Corps commander Brig-Gen Abbas Nilforoushan.Its attack also came after Israel announced a ground assault into Lebanon, in an effort to dismantle what it called Iran-backed Hezbollah's ""terrorist infrastructure"" in border villages.Biden's comment to reporters on Wednesday came during a trip to tour hurricane damage in North Carolina with Vice-President Kamala Harris.The US has repeatedly called for de-escalation and has also led long-running negotiations on a ceasefire between Israel and Palestinian armed group Hamas in Gaza but so far without success.Biden's comment to reporters on Wednesday came during a trip to tour hurricane damage in North Carolina with Vice-President Kamala Harris.He said the Iranian attack had been ""defeated and ineffective"", calling it ""a testament to intensive planning between the United States and Israel to anticipate and defend against the brazen attack we expected.""Make no mistake, the United States is fully, fully, fully supportive of Israel,"" Biden added.",Negative

"Trump 'resorted to crimes' to overturn 2020 election, prosecutors say A new filing presents the clearest view yet of how prosecutors would present their case against the former president at trial.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c93pdlg4dlno,"– Donald Trump ""resorted to crimes"" in an effort to overturn his 2020 election defeat, prosecutors allege in a new court filing that argues the former president is not immune from prosecution.Special Counsel Jack Smith, the prosecutor appointed to lead the election interference case against Trump, submitted the filing which was unsealed on Wednesday.It challenges Trump's claim that he is protected by a landmark Supreme Court ruling in July that gives broad immunity from prosecution for official acts conducted while in office.In the filing, prosecutors allege Trump was not always acting in an official capacity and instead engaged in a ""private criminal effort"" to overturn the 2020 results. The 165-page document is an effort by prosecutors to advance the criminal case against Trump following the Supreme Court ruling.""Big win for our constitution and democracy,"" Trump said at the time of the ruling, which was a major victory for the Republican candidate for president.It prompted prosecutors to narrow the scope of their indictment.It alleges that he always planned to declare victory no matter the result, and laid the groundwork for this long before election day.The case has been frequently delayed since charges were filed by the Department of Justice more than a year ago accusing Trump, who denies wrongdoing, of seeking to illegally block the certification of President Joe Biden's victory in January 2021.",Negative
