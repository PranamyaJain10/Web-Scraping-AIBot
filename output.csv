"‘No life left there’: The suburbs bearing the brunt of Israel’s strikes on Beirut Families have been left in despair after parts of Dahieh, a densely packed residential area, were reduced to rubble",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cz7jx575pg7o,"– Israel says it is targeting Hezbollah in order to safely return 60,000 of its own citizens to the north of Israel, which has come under rocket fire from Lebanon over the past year. But the BBC's analysis of video footage, Israeli evacuation warnings, and recent satellite imagery shows at least 65 air strikes which have severely damaged or completely destroyed buildings. Some of those strikes have comprised dozens of individual bombs, and many have leveled not only the apparent target building but destroyed or severely damaged several adjacent buildings too.This was the fate of Mehdi Moussawi thought his own building was falling down.From his balcony, the 45-year-old taxi driver and his wife Zahraa—who asked that their names be changed for this story—watched as a thick blanket of smoke and dust enveloped everything around them. Dahieh is often described as a Hezbollah stronghold.The term does not reflect the totality of the suburb—a densely packed residential area where other political parties operate and where not everyone supports Hezbollah—but the group is certainly the strongest force there.Israel says it is targeting Hezbollah in order to safely return 60,000 of its own citizens to the north of Israel, which has come under rocket fire from Lebanon over the past year.",Negative
Musk to give away $1m per day to Pennsylvania voters The winner will be chosen from those who sign a petition by the tech billionaire's Trump-supporting campaign group.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cg78ljxn8g7o,"– Tech billionaire Elon Musk has said he will give away $1m (£766,000) a day to a registered voter in the key swing state of Pennsylvania until the US presidential election in November.The winner will be chosen at random from those who sign a pro-constitution petition by Mr Musk's campaign group AmericaPAC which he set up to support Republican nominee Donald Trump's bid to return to the White House.Mr Musk's offer has raised questions around its legality.Prominent election law expert Rick Hasen wrote on his personal Election Law Blog that he believed Mr Musk's offer was ""clearly illegal.""Mr Musk had previously offered to give $47 to anyone who got a registered swing-state voter to sign the petition.Mr Musk, who has emerged as a key Trump supporter in recent years, launched AmericaPAC in July with the aim of supporting the former president's campaign.He has so far donated $75m (£57.5m) to the group, which has quickly become a central player in Trump's election campaign.The Trump campaign is highly reliant on outside groups such as AmericaPAC to canvas voters.Mr Musk said he wants to get ""over a million, maybe two million, voters in the battleground states to sign the petition in support of the First and Second Amendment.''",Positive
"Moscow had high hopes for Trump in 2016 - it's more cautious this time The looming US election presents Vladimir Putin with plenty to ponder, writes the BBC's Steve Rosenberg.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4g95r3lnr2o,"– President Vladimir Putin has even come out and backed the Democratic Party candidate, although that 'endorsement' was widely interpreted as a Kremlin joke (or Kremlin trolling).Putin claimed he liked Kamala Harris's 'infectious' laugh.' In Moscow, expectations were high that Trump would scrap sanctions against Russia; perhaps, even, recognize the Crimean Peninsula, annexed from Ukraine, as part of Russia.But you don't need to be a seasoned political pundit to understand that out on the campaign trail it's what Trump has been saying, not Harris, that's guaranteed to put a smile on Putin's face.In November 2016, Russian ultranationalist politician Vladimir Zhirinovsky was so excited by Donald Trump's victory, and so sure that it would transform US-Russian relations, he splashed out on 132 bottles of bubbly down at the Duma, Russia's parliament, and partied away (in his party offices) in front of the TV cameras.He wasn't the only one celebrating.Which is why, eight years on - publicly at least - Russian officials are more cautious about the prospect of a second Trump term.",Positive
"Hurricane Oscar hits Cuba as it struggles with power outage Millions of people are still without power, with food rotting in fridges and no water supply in many homes.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c8elzx8dg7zo,"– Hurricane Oscar has made landfall in eastern Cuba, packing winds of nearly 80mph (130km/h) on the third day of a nearly nationwide power outage.On Friday, the island's main energy plant failed and knocked out electricity for 10 million people.The category 1 hurricane made landfall near the city of Baracoa at 17:50 local time (21:50 GMT), and could cause flash-flooding and mudslides in eastern areas, according to the US National Hurricane Center.The communist president has blamed the decades-long US embargo for preventing much needed supplies and replacement parts from reaching Cuba.Food is now beginning to rot in fridges, and some families are having to cook with firewood.It is an increasingly critical situation, with schools and businesses closed and fears for the continued functioning of hospitals.The head of the National Electric Union (UNE) Alfredo Lpez Valdés also acknowledged the island had been facing a challenging energy situation, with shortages chiefly to blame.Friday's total blackout came after the Antonio Guiteras power plant in Matanzas - the largest on the island - went offline around 11:00 local time.It shows the fragility of our electricity system... We have no reserves, there is nothing to sustain the country, we are living day to day.""It's the worst I've seen in 47 years,"" she said.",Negative
Moldovans voting 'no' against pro-EU constitution change - early results,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1wnr5qdxe7o,"– Polls have closed in Moldova, where people have been voting in the country's presidential election and in a referendum on whether to enshrine the goal of joining the European Union in the constitution.With almost 90% of the referendum votes counted, the No vote was ahead with 53.9%, according to data shared by Moldova's electoral commission. A No victory would come as a surprise to many, as several recent surveys said 63% of voters would back the Yes campaign.Referring to widespread allegations of vote-buying linked to Russia, pro-EU President Maia Sandu said on Sunday evening that Moldova had faced an ""unprecedented assault"" on its democracy.She accused ""criminal groups"" of working together with ""foreign forces"" of using money, lies, and propaganda to sway the vote.The Kremlin has staunchly denied claims of vote-buying.In the presidential election, over 90% of the votes counted so far seem to indicate that Sandu has come out top.But she has failed to clinch more than half of the vote—meaning she and the second frontrunner, Aleksandr Stoianoglo, who is supported by the pro-Russian Party of Socialists, would go to a run-off on 3 November.",Negative

In recent weeks, the Israel military has been carrying out intense bombardment of northern Gaza, saying it wanted to prevent Hamas fighters from regrouping there.Israel has repeatedly denied it is preventing humanitarian aid from entering Gaza—but on Tuesday the US told it to boost access within 30 days or risk having some American military assistance cut off.",Negative
