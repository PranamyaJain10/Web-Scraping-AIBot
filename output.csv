"Democrat Party infighting exposes struggle to unite against Trump Sharp divides over how to push back against Trump and Republicans have been laid bare in Congress, writes Anthony Zurcher.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cr723zn40e5o,"– On Friday, Chuck Schumer, the Democratic leader in the Senate, found himself in a particularly uncomfortable position.President Donald Trump was singing his praises.And former Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries and other influential Democrats were expressing their dismay with him—or worse.This was Schumer's fate the day after he decided to back a Republican-crafted measure to avert a possible US government shutdown this weekend. Later, he followed through on his promise, voting with nine other Democrats and all but one Republican to overcome the key procedural hurdle that—if Democrats had stuck together in opposition—would have prevented the funding bill from coming to a final vote.The Senate bill, which passed that final vote shortly after, contained a number of provisions that angered liberals.Schumer acknowledged all of this, but said he was backing the bill because a shutdown, which would allow the president to determine what government services and employees to suspend, would be worse.""I believe it is the best way to minimize the harm that the Trump administration will do to the American people,"" he said on Friday.Democrats have the power to block Republican legislation, but they simply don't have the votes to advance their own alternative either in the House or the Senate.It didn't take long after Schumer's announcement for Democratic second guessing—and straight-up outrage—to ensue.""Chuck Schumer is unwilling and unable to meet the moment,"" the Democratic group Pass the Torch, which led calls for Joe Biden to end his re-election bid last summer, said in a statement.Pelosi, who wields considerable influence among House Democrats despite having stepped down from her leadership position, decried what she said was a ""false choice"" between a shutdown and accepting the Republican measure.""We must fight back in a better way,"" she said, suggesting a short-term funding extension and new bipartisan negotiations.",Negative
"US government shutdown averted as Senate passes spending bill The passage of the funding bill came hours before a shutdown, with Democrats under fierce pressure to oppose the measure.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c7vzjrm5lm8o,"– The US has averted a government shutdown after the Senate passed a Republican-led measure to keep the government funded for the next six months.The stopgap funding bill passed in the Senate 54-46, as two Democrats joined all but one Republican senator in voting yes.The key vote came earlier when some Senate Democrats, after fierce debate, allowed the measure to pass a procedural hurdle.The Senate minority leader, Democrat Chuck Schumer, and nine others broke with their colleagues to vote to advance the bill to its final Friday evening vote.Senator Ted Cruz accused the Democrats of conducting ""political theater"" and praised the bill's passage.""The government is funded, let's get back to work,"" he said in a statement.The passage is a victory for Trump and congressional Republicans.On Friday morning, Trump offered rare bipartisan praise of Schumer's decision to let the bill advance, writing that ""a non pass would be a Country destroyer, approval will lead us to new heights.""The legislation would keep much of the federal funding levels from the Biden Administration in place, with some key changes.It increases military spending by $6bn (£4.6bn), for items like border security, veterans healthcare, and military spending.However, the Senate approved a separate bill that kept its current operating budget intact.Senator Ted Cruz accused the Democrats of conducting ""political theater"" and praised the bill's passage.The Democrats had agonized over whether to support the measure, and eventually pushed for a 30-day continuing resolution that was unlikely to earn enough support to pass.",Positive

Tesla's share price has dropped 40% since the start of the year.Mr Musk is the carmaker's chief executive and while some have argued his alignment with the Trump administration is hurting its brand, market analysts say the share fall is more about worries over Tesla meeting production targets and a drop in sales over the past year.In the letter, Tesla said it was making changes to its supply chains to find as many local suppliers for its cars and batteries so it was less reliant on foreign markets.The US president has imposed an additional 20% tariff on all imports from China, prompting Beijing to respond with retaliatory levies including on cars.The letter was dated the same day that Trump hosted an event at the White House where he promised to buy a Tesla in a show of support for Mr Musk.",Neutral
"Iran using drones and apps to enforce women's dress code Iranian officials are encouraging people to report women who refuse to obey the Islamic republic's dress code, according to a UN report.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0kg15jkpdeo,"– Iran is using drones and intrusive digital technology to crush dissent, especially among women who refuse to obey the Islamic republic's strict dress code, the United Nations has said.Investigators say Iranian security officials are using a strategy of ""state-sponsored vigilantism"" to encourage people to use specialist phone apps to report women for alleged dress code violations in private vehicles such as taxis and ambulances.Their new report also highlights the increasing use of drones and security cameras to monitor hijab compliance in Tehran and in southern Iran.The findings of the Independent International Fact-Finding Mission on the Islamic republic's theocracy come after it determined last year that the country's theocracy was responsible for the ""physical violence"" that led to the death in custody of Mahsa Amini in 2022. Witnesses said the 22-year-old Kurd was badly beaten by the morality police during her arrest, but authorities denied she was mistreated and blamed ""sudden heart failure"" for her death.The report also established additional cases of sexual violence in custody, citing the case of one arrested woman who was beaten severely, subjected to two mock executions, raped and then gang-raped.The report will be presented to the Human Rights Council on 18 March.",Negative

'Tortured and terrified' - BBC witnesses the battle for Khartoum,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwyg8x8v33ko,"– The BBC has heard evidence of atrocities committed by retreating fighters in a battle raging for control of Sudan's capital city Khartoum.The city has been held by the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) since the start of the country's brutal civil war nearly two years ago—but the army has retaken much of it and believes it is on track to seize the rest.Regaining the capital would be a tremendous victory for the military and a turning-point in the war, although by itself would not end the conflict.In recent weeks troops have mostly encircled Khartoum, coming up from the south after surging through central Sudan, and clearing city districts in the north and east, squeezing the remaining RSF fighters into the center.Vast areas of the reclaimed territory are completely destroyed.The army and allied militias have been accused of carrying out widespread atrocities after recapturing territory, in particular the central Gezira state.The UN and US say both sides have committed war crimes, but singled out the RSF for criticism of mass rape and accusations of genocide.",Negative
