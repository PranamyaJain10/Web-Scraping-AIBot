Dark arts in Hollywood - how the powerful publicity smear machine changed The Blake Lively and Justin Baldoni feud has shone a light on a part of the entertainment industry that many of those within it would rather remain invisible.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwyj3vnkyn8o,"– ""Some of a publicist's best work may never be seen,"" says Daniel Bee, a publicist and brand consultant based in Los Angeles, ""because it stopped something that was wrong, or re-crafted something to a different narrative, or pointed the light in a different direction.""Since Daniel Bee started out as an entertainment publicist in 1997, he has observed a shift in the wider industry. ""I started my career in the British media, there were 11 national newspapers competing with each other.It was a bear pit, hard work, and it was getting to know individuals via relationships.Now, you're up against an anonymous algorithm and accounts where you don't know who you're up against.But behind the scenes, hundreds of other spats will never see the light of day.Hollywood rivalries are of course nothing new - yet conflicts today rarely play out so publicly.The world of the Hollywood PR has shifted in recent years, partly because of the growth of social media, which has changed the relationship between celebrities and fans, bringing them into direct contact and removing some of the mystique.",Positive

'Living in a reel': How Alzheimer's left Gene Hackman alone in his final days The actor may not have known his wife was dead inside the home he was living in because of the disease.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cpv419jp3v9o,"– Gene Hackman was alone. The two-time Academy Award winner didn't make any calls and missed meals. Medical experts say it's possible the 95-year-old, who was in declining health and suffering from advanced stages of Alzheimer's disease, did not even realize his wife of more than 30 years was dead in the home where he was living. If he did, experts told the BBC, he likely went through various stages of confusion and grief, trying to wake her up before the disease caused him to become distracted or too overwhelmed to act—a process that likely repeated for days before he, too, died. Officials in New Mexico say Betsy Arakawa, 65, died of a rare virus about seven days before Hackman perished on 18 February of natural causes. ""A person might feel worried or frightened, but at the same time they might not be capable to take the actions that you or I might normally think to do in order to alleviate that worry or concern, such as calling somebody else, or going to speak to a neighbor.""It's a lot to shoulder.""",Negative

"How JD Vance sees the world - and why that matters In a speech to allies and in that infamous Oval Office row, the vice-president came out punching - but what is he fighting for?",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cly82yx09zeo,"– It was a bold and perhaps unexpected way to introduce himself to the world - by angering European allies.But days later he was back in the news, at the center of a blistering row with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, whom he accused of being ungrateful.Vance's view, the Trump administration's priority should be to make life better for Americans who have been in the country for generations, and yet have little of the nation's vast wealth.In Vance's view, the Trump administration's priority should be to make life better for Americans who have been in the country for generations, and yet have little of the nation's vast wealth.Vance has repeatedly returned to this ""America First"" - or perhaps ""Americans First"" - theme in speeches, drawing a line between what he castigates as Washington's economic and foreign policy orthodoxy abroad and the struggles of the left-behind American working class at home.Vance has repeatedly returned to this ""America First"" - or perhaps ""Americans First"" - theme in speeches, drawing a line between what he castigates as Washington's economic and foreign policy orthodoxy abroad and the struggles of the left-behind American working class at home.But Vance is also someone who, after a tough upbringing in an Ohio family with Appalachian roots and sudden fame on the back of a bestselling memoir, Hillbilly Elegy, has tried out many different views.Not only is he a former 'Never Trumper' who described the US president in 2016 as'reprehensible' and 'an idiot', his book places much of the blame for the plight of the rural poor squarely on the choices made by individuals.'",Negative
"Facebook was 'hand in glove' with China, BBC told Social media company considered letting Beijing control content for access to its lucrative market, BBC told.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cly820v99ppo,"– A former senior Facebook executive has told the BBC how the social media giant worked ""hand in glove"" with the Chinese government on potential ways of allowing Beijing to censor and control content in China.Sarah Wynn-Williams - a former global public policy director - says in return for gaining access to the Chinese market of hundreds of millions of users, Facebook's founder, Mark Zuckerberg, considered agreeing to hiding posts that were going viral, until they could be checked by the Chinese authorities.Ms Williams - who makes the claims in a new book - has also filed a whistleblower complaint with the US markets regulator, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), alleging Meta misled investors.Meta referred us to Mark Zuckerberg's comments from 2019, when he said: 'We could never come to agreement on what it would take for us to operate there, and they [China] never let us in.' Facebook also used algorithms to spot when young teenagers were feeling vulnerable as part of research aimed at advertisers, Ms Wynn-Williams alleges.Ms Wynn-Williams claims that in the mid-2010s, as part of its negotiations with the Chinese government, Facebook considered allowing it future access to Chinese citizens' user data.Ms Wynn-Williams says governments frequently asked for explanations of how aspects of Facebook's software worked, but were told it was proprietary information.""But when it came to the Chinese, the curtain was pulled back,"" she says.""They said: 'The business side thinks this is exactly what we should be doing.'Meta told the BBC this was false - it has never offered young people, which is a really important advertising segment.'""",Positive
