"1,329 tiny snails released on remote island Conservationists released the critically endangered snails to help restore a remote island habitat.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4gxqep4zk3o,"– More than 1,300 pea-sized, critically endangered snails that were bred in a zoo have been set free to wander (very slowly) on a remote Atlantic island. The release brings two species of Desertas Island land snails back to the wild. Prior to this they were believed to be extinct—neither species had been spotted for a century. When a team of conservationists found a small population surviving on the rocky cliffs of Deserta Grande island, close to Madeira, they mounted a rescue effort. The tiny molluscs are native to the windswept, mountainous island of Deserta Grande, just south-east of Madeira. Habitat there has been destroyed by rats, mice, and goats that were brought to the island by humans. It was thought that all these invasive predators had eaten the tiny snails to extinction. Then a series of conservation expeditions—between 2012 and 2017— proved otherwise. Conservationists discovered just 200 surviving individuals on the island. At Chester Zoo, the conservation science team made a new home for 60 of the precious snails. The right food, vegetation and conditions were recreated in miniature habitat tanks. 1,329 snail offspring, bred at the zoo, have now been marked with identification dots—using non-toxic pens and nail varnish—and transported back to the wild for release.",Positive
