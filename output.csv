Trump to fly to Scotland for golf club visits - and a meeting with UK PM His private visit is exceptional as US presidents rarely promote their personal interests so publicly while in office.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cg4r4z2gx2qo,"– Donald Trump flies into Scotland later to visit two golf resorts which he owns in the country where his mother was born.He will travel to Turnberry in South Ayrshire, a world class venue he bought in 2014, and to Menie in Aberdeenshire to open a new 18-hole course.The White House says Trump will also meet prime minister Sir Keir Starmer to discuss trade while he is in the UK.The trip is exceptional as US presidents rarely promote their personal interests so publicly while in office.It is not the first time that Trump has been accused of conflating his own affairs with the nation's.Even so, with Gaza and Ukraine in flames, the dollar on the slide, and questions mounting about his ties to convicted paedophile, Jeffrey Epstein, Trump's decision to focus on golf has raised eyebrows.I witnessed Trump's unconventional attitude first hand, right at the start of his political career, when I met him on the campaign trail in 2015 as the Republicans searched for a candidate who could win back the presidency after Barack Obama's two terms in office.Trump strode off the debate stage in a glitzy Las Vegas hotel and into a room packed with cameras.Giant transport aircraft carrying military hardware, including the president's helicopters, known when he is on board by the call sign Marine One, have been spotted at Aberdeen and Prestwick airports.Roads and lanes in Aberdeenshire and have been secured and closed.Police Scotland insists it has the resources it needs to deal with the visit.",Positive
"The fractured friendship behind the fight at the Thailand-Cambodia border The countries have a history of occasional conflict, but this latest fight comes after an old friendship crumbled.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvg1gdgy2pyo,"– The two countries share a long and forested border with areas that both sides claim.There have been serious exchanges of fire in the past, too—in 2008 and 2011, clashes on a similar scale saw 40 people killed.However, these were de-escalated relatively quickly.Even as recently as this May, after an incident in which a Cambodian soldier was killed, both sides looked keen to prevent more violence, with meetings between army commanders from each country aimed at easing the tension.But on Thursday, it erupted. Thai authorities said at least 14 people, all civilians apart from one, had been killed so far, as fighting continued on Friday.Cambodia has yet to confirm whether it suffered any casualties.So why has this particular border skirmish—which kicked off after five Thai soldiers were injured in a landmine explosion on Wednesday—spread into something so much larger?Relations between the two countries deteriorated sharply last month, when Cambodia's senior leader Hun Sen deeply embarrassed Thai Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra by leaking a phone conversation between them about the disputed border.The two countries have also cooperated in more shadowy areas.Last November, Thailand sent six Cambodian dissidents, together with a young child, back to Cambodia, where they were immediately jailed.At the border itself, there is a heightened risk of more serious clashes between the two armies.But rather than back off, Cambodia's Hun Sen seems to have jumped at the opportunity to ramp up rhetoric against Thailand and the Shinawatra family in particular.",Negative

Other players then entered the room and engaged in further sexual acts with her.Lawyer Karen Bellehumeur, speaking on EM's behalf, said the woman had tuned in to Thursday's hearing virtually and was ""very disappointed"" with the judge's assessment of her credibility.Justice Carroccia said she did not find EM's evidence ""credible or reliable"" and that ""the Crown cannot meet its onus on any of the counts.""The players are Michael McLeod, Dillon Dube, Cal Foote, Alex Formenton, Alex Formenton and Carter Hart, and all were with the National Hockey League when the allegations surfaced, although one was playing in Europe.",Negative
Justice department official meets Epstein accomplice Maxwell,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cjd2de8zz5go,"– A senior justice department official met Jeffrey Epstein's long-time associate Ghislaine Maxwell on Thursday as pressure grows on the Trump administration to release files linked to the disgraced financier's sex trafficking network.The meeting took place in Tallahassee, Florida, where Maxwell is serving a 20-year sentence for sex trafficking.An attorney for Maxwell, David Markus, told the BBC's US partner CBS News that he would not comment on the ""substance"" of the discussions but said ""there were a lot of questions and we went all day.""She answered every one of them,"" he said. Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche had said earlier this week that he planned to speak to Maxwell about any information she had on other people whom Epstein may have helped sexually abuse girls.Epstein died in a New York prison cell in 2019 while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges, following an earlier conviction for soliciting prostitution from a minor.On Wednesday, the Wall Street Journal reported that Attorney General Pam Bondi informed Trump during a May briefing that his name appeared in DOJ documents related to the Epstein case.House Speaker Mike Johnson has warned that Maxwell—who for years helped Epstein groom and sexually abuse girls— cannot be trusted to provide accurate testimony.Her attorney, David Oscar Markus, told the BBC the concerns were ""unfounded"" and that if she chose to testify, rather than invoke her constitutional right to remain silent, ""she would testify truthfully, as she always has said she would.""It's the first time the government did it.",Negative
Pro-Palestinian convict to be freed by France after 41 years,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvg8gmly8gno,"– Georges Abdallah, a 74-year-old Lebanese teacher who became a left-wing symbol for the Palestinian cause, is to be freed by France on Friday after 41 years in jail.Described by his lawyer as ""the man who has spent the longest time in prison for events linked to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict,"" Abdallah is expected to be put on a flight directly to Beirut.Convicted in 1987 for complicity in the murders in France of two diplomats—one American, one Israeli—Abdallah has gradually been forgotten by the wider public.But his release remained a cause célbre for activists on the Marxist-Leninist left, with which he still identifies. Born in 1951 into a Christian family in northern Lebanon, in the late 1970s Abdallah helped set up the Lebanese Armed Revolutionary Factions (LARF)—a small Marxist group dedicated to fighting Israel and its closest ally, the United States.Abdallah's group decided to hit Israeli and US targets in Europe, and carried out five attacks in France.In 1982 its members shot and killed US diplomat Charles Ray in Strasbourg, and Israeli diplomat Yakov Barsimantov in Paris.This is a victory for justice, but it is also a political scandal that he was not released before, thanks to the behavior of the United States and successive French presidents.""If I had not had that... well, 40 years—it can turn your brain to mush,"" he said.On the walls of his cell, Abdallah kept a picture of the 1960s revolutionary Che Guevara and postcards from supporters around the world.",Negative
