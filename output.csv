'Grandpa robbers' held Kim Kardashian at gunpoint - but didn't know who she was Suspects who are accused of robbing Kim Kardashian at gunpoint in October 2016 stand trial in Paris.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cpdzp06698zo,"– Kim Kardashian was robbed at gunpoint in a luxury Paris hotel in October 2016.All her jewelry had been taken for a sum of about $10m—including the jewels her then-husband and rapper Kanye West gifted her, which alone was worth $4m—but a series of blunders meant the heist was doomed from the start and in early 2017—three months after the robbery—Abbas and several of his alleged accomplices were arrested.Ten of them will now be appearing in court in Paris in a trial set to last just under three weeks.Most of them were born in the 1950s, leading French media to dub them the ""grandpa robbers.""Abbas and a 68-year-old man, Aomar Ait Khedache, have confessed; the others have not.One has since passed away, and another, aged 81, will be excused as he is suffering from advanced dementia.The Kardashian robbery, he later wrote in a memoir, was going to be his last job before retirement.But a series of blunders meant the heist was doomed from the start and in early 2017—three months after the robbery—Abbas and several of his alleged accomplices were arrested.",Negative
Israel launches air strike on Beirut Israel said it hit a Hezbollah missile store. The Lebanese presidency urged the US and France to press Israel to cease its attacks.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c9qw3z5xplro,"– Israel carried out an air strike on Beirut's southern suburbs on Sunday, after ordering an evacuation of a building that it said was being used by the Iranian-backed group Hezbollah.The attack occurred despite a ceasefire that came into force five months ago which put an end to the conflict between Israel and the military group.Israel said that it had targeted a Hezbollah store of ""precision-guided missiles"" that ""poses a threat to the State of Israel and its civilians.""The storage of missiles in this infrastructure site constitutes a blatant violation of the understandings between Israel and Lebanon, and poses a threat to the State of Israel and its civilians,"" the Israeli military said in a statement.The Lebanese presidency condemned the strike and called on the US and France—who brokered the ceasefire in November—to press Israel to cease its attacks on the country.The attack marks the first time in almost a month that Israel has struck Beirut's southern suburbs—called Dahieh—where Hezbollah is based.This will put further pressure on the ceasefire. Earlier this month an Israeli airstrike in Beirut's southern suburbs killed four people, including a Hezbollah official.",Negative
Pope Francis' tomb adorned with single rose as first images released The late pontiff was laid to rest in a private ceremony on Saturday following a public funeral at the Vatican on Saturday.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn91peprnl2o,"– Images of Pope Francis's tomb at the Santa Maria Maggiore church in Rome have been released.A single white rose was pictured lying on the stone tomb that bears the name he was known by during his pontificate, below a crucifix illuminated by a single spotlight.The late pope was laid to rest at the church—one of four major basilicas in the Italian capital, and one he would regularly visit during his time as cardinal and pontiff—in a private ceremony following his public funeral in the Vatican on Saturday.Thousands of mourners have been filing past the tomb since the church opened to the public on Sunday morning to pay their respects to Pope Francis, who died aged 88 on Monday.Francis was particularly devoted to the Virgin Mary, and Santa Maria Maggiore was the first church to be dedicated to her when it was built in the 4th Century.The basilica sits near the Colosseum, a stone's throw from the city's endlessly bustling and chaotic central Termini station—well beyond the limits of the Vatican, where popes are traditionally entombed.It was one the South American pontiff had a long-held affinity for.Its senior priest previously told an Italian newspaper that Pope Francis had said he wished to be laid to rest there in 2022, citing inspiration from the Virgin Mary.""I thought it was amazing that he wanted to be buried here in this basilica,"" Amaya Morris, another pilgrim, told AP.Following the public funeral, Pope Francis's coffin was carried through Rome in a slow procession. Authorities said 140,000 people had lined the streets, clapping and waving as the hearse—a repurposed white popemobile—crossed the Tiber river and drove past some of Rome's most recognizable sights: the Colosseum, the Forum and the Altare della Patria national monument on Piazza Venezia.",Negative
"The rapid remaking of a nation, in 100 days The impact of what President Trump has done so far is being felt in every corner of American life.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cly1n7jz587o,"– Donald Trump constantly repeated his intention to bring about dramatic change as soon as he returned to the White House.But few expected it to come at such breakneck speed.Three weeks into the new term, at 10.13am on a Sunday morning, Vice-President JD Vance wrote nine words that signaled a strategy which has since shaped the Trump administration's second term.Some of the biggest clashes have been over Trump's immigration crackdown.The courts have been more resistant, with well over 100 rulings so far halting presidential actions they deem to be unconstitutional, according to a tally by the New York Times.The richest man in the world, who wants to cut trillions of dollars from the federal government, said he had a special surprise.Argentinian President Javier Milei, known for his own budget-slashing, emerged from backstage and handed him a shiny gold chainsaw.It was a dramatic illustration not only of Musk's enthusiasm for his 'Department of Government Efficiency' (Doge) assignment, but also of the near rock-star status that the South African-born technologist has developed among the Trump faithful.The White House has moved aggressively to wrest control of spending from Congress, unilaterally defunding programs and entire agencies.This erosion of its power has been largely met by silence on Capitol Hill, where Trump's Republicans hold slim majorities in both chambers.The courts have been more resistant, with well over 100 rulings so far halting presidential actions they deem to be unconstitutional, according to a tally by the New York Times.",Positive
Trump 'thinks' Zelensky ready to give up Crimea to Russia The latest comments by the US president come despite Kyiv repeatedly rejecting ceding the peninsula.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c20z20kyvxxo,"– US President Donald Trump has said he thinks his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelensky is willing to give up Crimea to Russia as part of a peace deal—despite Kyiv's previous rejections of any such proposal.Asked if he thought the Ukrainian president was ready to cede control of its southern peninsula, which was illegally annexed by Russia in 2014, Trump replied: ""I think so.""Trump also urged Russian President Vladimir Putin to ""stop shooting, sit down and sign a deal"" to end the fighting, suggesting this could be achieved within two weeks. German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius warned Ukraine not to agree to a deal which involves sweeping territorial concessions in return for a ceasefire.He told German public broadcaster ARD that Kyiv ""should not go as far as the latest proposal by the American president"", which he said would amount to a ""capitulation.""Ukraine could have got a year ago what was included in that proposal, it is akin to a capitulation.Trump said last week that ""most of the major points [of the deal] are agreed to.""Germany could have got a year ago what was included in that proposal, it is akin to a capitulation.I cannot discern any added value.""",Negative
Myanmar's army vowed a ceasefire after the earthquake.

Mourning turns to anger in Iran after massive port explosion kills 40,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0782l4yx78o,"– The explosion happened on Saturday morning at Shahid Rajaee port.It is a reminder that while Iran has been rocked physically by the blast—residents up to 30 miles away reported feeling the effects—the country is now being rocked by a growing blame game too.The firm said it believed that the affected containers had contained solid fuel destined for ballistic missiles, and was aware that an Iran-flagged ship ""discharged a shipment of sodium perchlorate rocket fuel at the port in March 2025.""We have come to see first-hand if there is anything or any issue that the government can follow up on,"" said Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian visited the scene of the explosion on Sunday, saying: ""We have come to see first-hand if there is anything or any issue that the government can follow up on.""The New York Times quoted a person with ties to Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, speaking on condition of anonymity, as saying that what exploded was sodium perchlorate—a major ingredient in solid fuel for missiles.Some Iranians are asking whether they should believe speculation on social media which said Iran's military and Revolutionary Guard were storing rocket fuel that they had recently imported from China at the port—a claim which has been denied by an army spokesman.",Negative
Beijing seizes disputed sandbank in South China Sea,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/creqp4lxnl4o,"– China's coast guard has seized a tiny sandbank in the South China Sea, state media has reported, in an escalation of a regional dispute with the Philippines.State broadcaster CCTV released images of four officers, wearing all black and holding the Chinese flag, standing on the disputed reef of Sandy Cay in the Spratly Islands.Both China and the Philippines have staked claims on various islands.The Philippines said later on Sunday that it had landed on three sandbanks, releasing an image of officers holding up their national flag in a pose that mimicked the Chinese photo.It is unclear whether one of the sandbanks the Philippines security forces landed on was also Sandy Cay.The Chinese move comes as US and Philippine forces are carrying out their annual war scenario drills—called the Balikatan exercises.China claims by far the largest portion of territory in an area demarcated by its so-called ""nine-dash line.""This operation reflects the unwavering dedication and commitment of the Philippine Government to uphold the country's sovereignty, sovereign rights and jurisdiction in the West Philippine Sea,"" the statement said.The dispute between the two nations has been escalating, with frequent confrontations including vessels colliding and scuffles.China claims by far the largest portion of territory in an area demarcated by its so-called ""nine-dash line.""This type of training is absolutely invaluable to us,"" said Third Marine Littoral Regiment Officer John Lehane.The exercise has helped allay fears among some US allies that Donald Trump may upend the years-long military support it has provided in the region.",Negative
