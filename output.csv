US top court leans towards TikTok ban over security concerns The platform with nearly 170 million American users is challenging a law that would see it banned in the US in a matter of days.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cz9g91gn5ddo,"– The Supreme Court appears poised to uphold a law that bans TikTok in the US over national security concerns unless its China-based parent company sells the platform ahead of a 19 January deadline.The Court's nine justices heard from lawyers representing TikTok, and content creators that the ban would be a violation of free speech protections for the platform's more than 170 million users in the US.The US government argued that without a sale, TikTok could be used by China as a tool for spying and political manipulation.President-elect Donald Trump—who returns to the White House in just over a week—now argues against the ban.The law requires TikTok's parent company ByteDance to sell it in the US or cease operations on 19 January.Jeffrey L Fisher, a Stanford University law professor representing creators who sued over the law, told the court on Friday that the country has historically faced ""ideological campaigns by foreign adversaries.""It will fundamentally change the landscape with respect to what ByteDance might consider,"" she said, comparing the situation to ""game of chicken"" and one in which the US should not ""blink first.""The legislation does not forbid use of the app, but would require tech giants such as Apple and Google to stop offering it and inhibit updates, which analysts suggest would kill it over time.TikTok has repeatedly denied any potential influence by the Chinese Communist Party and has said the law violates the First Amendment free speech rights of its users.President-elect Donald Trump—who returns to the White House in just over a week—now argues against the ban.",Negative

Fewer rate cuts and higher loan costs - how US jobs surprise affects you,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cdd97z26152o,"– The US central bank, which is charged with keeping both prices and employment stable, cut interest rates for the first time in more than four years in September, saying it wanted to head off signs of weakness in the jobs market. But the strength of this month's data suggests fears about the jobs market may have been premature, removing pressure on the bank to act. Interest rates on 10 and 30-year government debt in the US jumped after the report, with the latter topping 5%. Investors had already been paring back bets on cuts this year, worried by signs that the bank's progress on stabilizing prices was stalling. Nathaniel Casey, investment strategist at wealth management firm Evelyn Partners, called it ""the goldilocks of labor market releases."" Even if inflation data due next week shows inflation—the rate of price increases—cooling, Ellen Zentner, chief economic strategist for Morgan Stanley Wealth Management, said this jobs data means she doesn't expect the Fed ""to cut rates any time soon.""",Positive
