"Trump orders troops to US-Mexico border as part of immigration crackdown The order will deploy 1,500 troops to build physical barriers, but they will not be used for law enforcement, a military official says.",https://www.bbc.com/news/live/cn0y51z7wedt,"– President Trump has granted a full and unconditional pardon to Andrew Zabavsky and Terrence Sutton, two former Washington DC police officers who were convicted in 2022 over the death of Karon Hylton-Brown.

"Trump comes out swinging in rapid start to presidency He has made waves with dozens of actions that represent a substantial expansion of White House power, writes Anthony Zurcher.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1ez6313g4po,"– It's been three days since President Donald Trump took office.And he has come out swinging.On the 2024 campaign trail, he promised to bring rapid and sweeping change to American government and society if he were re-elected.Some of his policies and reforms will take time—and congressional legislation—to enact.Other moves might be blocked by the courts.But in the first days of his presidency, however, Trump has already made waves with dozens of unilateral orders and actions that represent a substantial expansion of White House power.For many of his supporters - so far—it looks like he has delivered on his promises.""He signed all the executive orders that he told us he was going to do,"" said 68-year-old Rick Frazier, a loyal Trump supporter from Ohio who has attended more than 80 of his rallies.Trump has also ordered authorities to stop granting automatic citizenship to the children of undocumented migrants born on American soil—setting up a lengthy legal battle over what had previously been viewed by courts as a constitutional guarantee.One step that Trump repeatedly promised—but has yet to show signs of implementing—is mass deportations of migrants who crossed illegally into the US, something he said would start on day one of his presidency.While some Trump officials have said the deportation process has begun, there have been no signs yet of the kind of law-enforcement raids or other expansive actions that would be necessary to detain and remove the millions of undocumented migrants who currently reside in the US.Mr Frazier's daughter died of a heroin overdose last year.",Negative
Congress passes Laken Riley Act in early win for Trump on immigration Forty-six Democrats defy party leadership and cross the political aisle to support the Republican measure.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cj482l0kw7qo,"– The US Congress has passed a bill requiring undocumented immigrants who are arrested for theft or violent crimes to be held in jail pending trial. The bill, named after Laken Riley—a Georgia nursing student murdered last year by a Venezuelan man—passed the House of Representatives a day after it was approved by the Senate.The measure cruised through the House by a vote of 263 to 156. Forty-six Democrats defied their party leadership and crossed the political aisle to support the Republican measure. It now heads to the White House for President Donald Trump to sign into law—an early legislative win for his fledgling administration on a bill named after a woman whom he often invoked during his campaign.The bill does not come with new funding for immigration control measures, leading to criticism from Democrats that it will be too expensive to fully implement.The National Institute of Justice study suggests that undocumented migrants in the US are arrested for violent and drug crimes at less than half the rate of native-born citizens.",Negative
"Giant iceberg on crash course with island - penguins and seals in danger More than twice the size of greater London, the expanse of ice is unpredictable and dangerous.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cd64vvg4z6go,"– The world's largest iceberg is on a collision course with a remote British island, potentially putting penguins and seals in danger.The iceberg is spinning northwards from Antarctica towards South Georgia, a rugged British territory and wildlife haven, where it could ground and smash into pieces.It is currently 173 miles (280km) away.Countless birds and seals died on South Georgia's icy coves and beaches when past giant icebergs stopped them feeding.""Icebergs are inherently dangerous. I would be extraordinarily happy if it just completely missed us,"" sea captain Simon Wallace tells BBC News, speaking from the South Georgia government vessel Pharos.It is known as A23a and is one of the world's oldest.It calved, or broke off, from the Filchner Ice Shelf in Antarctica in 1986 but got stuck on the seafloor and then trapped in an ocean vortex.Finally, in December, it broke free and is now on its final journey, speeding into oblivion.The warmer waters north of Antarctica are melting and weakening its vast cliffs that tower up to 1,312ft (400m), taller than the Shard in London.It once measured 3,900 sq km, but the latest satellite pictures show it is slowly decaying. A23a could break into vast segments any day, which may then hang around for years, like floating cities of ice cruising around South Georgia.In 2004 one called A38 grounded on its continental shelf, leaving dead penguin chicks and seal pups on beaches as massive ice chunks blocked their access to feeding grounds.The territory is home to precious colonies of King Emperor penguins and millions of elephant and fur seals.",Negative
Canada says it can help the US achieve its 'golden age' It is the latest pitch by Justin Trudeau as his country tries to avoid a trade war with the US.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c87dpv95lr8o,"– Canada has been preparing a retaliatory response for weeks, and was ready for a potentially devastating trade war to be launched as soon as President Trump took office.Trump had initially tied the tariffs to border security, saying they will be implemented until Canada and Mexico make moves to limit the flow of fentanyl and unlawful migrants into the US.But this appears to not be enough, with Trump doubling down on his threats, accusing Canada on Tuesday of allowing ""millions"" of people to come into the US unlawfully.Trump has also criticized Canada over its defense spending and what he says is a trade deficit between the two countries.Experts say the deficit is due to a number of factors, including the fluctuating price of energy—one of the main commodities Canada sells to the US.Canada has been preparing a retaliatory response for weeks, and was ready for a potentially devastating trade war to be launched as soon as President Trump took office.Trump had initially tied the tariffs to border security, saying they will be implemented until Canada and Mexico make moves to limit the flow of fentanyl and unlawful migrants into the US.Canada has been preparing a retaliatory response for weeks, and was ready for a potentially devastating trade war to be launched as soon as President Trump took office.Trump has also criticized Canada over its defense spending and what he says is a trade deficit between the two countries.Experts say the deficit is due to a number of factors, including the fluctuating price of energy—one of the main commodities Canada sells to the US.Canada's oil patch rattled by Trump's tariffs hurt US consumers?",Negative
