"England's last executed 'witch' may have survived A spelling error in a court document could mean the woman was not hanged, a Southampton historian says.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4g2prk3v2eo,"– The last woman believed to have been executed in England for witchcraft may have avoided the gallows, according to new research.Prof Mark Stoyle, a historian at the University of Southampton, believes a spelling error by a court official meant the accused woman was not hanged, but instead lived for several years.Alice Molland was sentenced at Exeter Castle, Devon, in 1685 for ""bewitching"" three of her neighbors.She was presumed to have been executed in the city's Heavitree area in the same year, making her England's last executed witch. Prof Stoyle's research suggests that the court documents from the time contained a spelling mistake, and Alice Molland might actually have been called Avis Molland.He said: ""Court records from the 17th century were written in Latin, and in this form it would only have taken a single mis-stroke of the clerk of the court's pen to transform 'Avicia' (Avis) into 'Alicia' (Alice).""Almost nothing is known about Alice's life and attempts to illuminate it have failed.""Molland was an unusual name in Exeter, so when Prof Stoyle saw a reference to an Avis Molland in some local archives, he was struck by its close resemblance.He said: ""I immediately asked myself, did Alice Molland ever exist? Is Alice, in fact, Avis?"" According to records from the time, Avis Molland had been married with three children - but they all died.""By the time of the 1685 trial, Avis Molland was a poor, middle-aged widow, who was burdened with loss - precisely the kind of woman who was likely to be accused of witchcraft in early modern England.He added circumstantial evidence suggested Avis had been imprisoned at Exeter Castle at the same time as the trial for Alice was listed.Had there been a simple spelling mistake, the last executed witches in 1693.",Negative

Musk denies this.Philadelphia District Attorney Lawrence Krasner sued Musk this week over the $1m (£770,000) giveaways and said Musk ""must be stopped, immediately, before the upcoming presidential election.""At a hearing on Thursday, Judge Angelo Foglietta said the lawsuit will be put on hold while a federal court decides whether to take up the case.Musk's PAC was also warned by the US justice department that its lottery-style giveaway might violate federal election law.It is unlikely the case will be resolved before Tuesday's election.Musk could face a $10,000 fine and up to five years in prison if a court finds he broke the law.Musk himself, who has been aggressively campaigning for Trump, has insisted voters who want to be eligible for the prizes do not need to register as Republicans or go ahead with casting a vote.",Negative
