"Daniel Penny acquitted in chokehold death of homeless man on NY subway The case sparked weeks of protests and reignited national debate over race, mental illness, and public safety in the US.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/crrw0881gzvo,"– A 26-year-old man has been acquitted of homicide for putting an unarmed homeless man in a fatal chokehold, a case that sparked weeks of protests and reignited debates over public safety, mental illness, and race.Jurors deliberated for five days before declaring Daniel Penny not guilty beyond a reasonable doubt in the death of 30-year-old Jordan Neely on a New York City subway train on 1 May 2023.The verdict comes after prosecutors agreed to drop a more serious charge of second-degree manslaughter on Friday, as jurors could not reach an agreement. Neely's death sparked protests across the city and reignited debates over public transportation safety and how the city cares for those struggling with mental health issues and homelessness.On Monday, following the verdict, Vice-President-elect JD Vance wrote on X that ""it was a scandal Penny was ever prosecuted in the first place"".""It hurts. It really, really hurts,"" Mr Zachery said outside court.We couldn't be more pleased that a jury of Danny's peers acquitted him of any wrongdoing,"" his lawyers said in a statement afterwards.Neely's father, Andre Zachery, was removed from court for shouting after the verdict.The manslaughter charge against Mr Penny would have carried a 15-year maximum sentence, while the negligent homicide charge carries a four-year-maximum.A medical examiner ruled Neely's cause of death as compression to the neck. Witnesses said that Neely - who suffered from severe mental illnesses - began shouting at other subway passengers, asking for money and screaming that he was hungry and wanted to go back to jail.One woman on the train said that Neely made lunging movements that scared her enough to shield her young child from him.Penny's legal team argued that he only stepped in after Neely began threatening passengers.",Negative
"Google unveils 'mind-boggling' quantum computing chip It solves in five minutes a problem computers now would need 10,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 years to work out, Google says.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c791ng0zvl3o,"– Google has unveiled a new chip which it claims takes five minutes to solve a problem that would currently take the world's fastest super computers 10 septillion—or 10,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 years—to complete.The chip is the latest development in a field known as quantum computing—which is attempting to use the principles of particle physics to create a new type of mind-bogglingly powerful computer.Google says its new quantum chip, dubbed Willow, incorporates key ""breakthroughs"" and ""paves the way to a useful, large-scale quantum computer.""However experts say Willow is, for now, a largely experimental device, meaning a quantum computer powerful enough to solve a wide range of real-world problems is still years—and billions of dollars—away. Quantum computers work in a fundamentally different way to the computer in your phone or laptop.They harness quantum mechanics—the strange behavior of ultra-tiny particles—to crack problems far faster than traditional computers.It's hoped quantum computers might eventually be able to use that ability to vastly speed up complex processes, such as creating new medicines.Google researchers say they have reversed this and managed to engineer and program the new chip so the error rate fell across the whole system as the number of qubits increased.It was a major ""breakthrough"" that cracked a key challenge that the field had pursued ""for almost 30 years"", Mr Neven believes.It was comparable to ""if you had an airplane with just one engine—that will work, but two engines are safer, four engines is yet safer.""",Positive
