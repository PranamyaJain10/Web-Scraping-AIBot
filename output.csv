Emmanuel Macron stood in front of the masterpiece by Leonardo da Vinci as he made the announcement to an audience of dignitaries, with the change to be introduced by 2031 and visitors charged separately to see the painting. The French president was outlining his New Renaissance project, which will also involve an international competition to design a second entrance to relieve the growing pressure of visitor numbers beneath the famous glass Pyramid.Tariff changes will also be introduced from next January so non-EU residents - including UK tourists - pay more to visit.Macron said the new front - the biggest change to the museum since President Franois Mitterrand's Grand Louvre project 40 years ago - would tie in with city plans to create a tree-filled ""green"" zone on the esplanade.About three-quarters of the museum's 30,000 daily visitors go to see Leonardo da Vinci's painting, but the experience has become an endurance test, with a constant crowd being funnelled through the Salle des Etats and getting on average 50 seconds to observe the picture and take photos.Macron said the project would cost the taxpayer nothing, as it would be funded through ticket sales, donations, and the museum's sponsorship deal with the Louvre Abu Dhabi.",Positive

Tanner Fox, 24, was sentenced on Tuesday by a British Columbia Supreme Court judge. Fox and Jose Lopez pleaded guilty in October to the second-degree murder of Sikh businessman Ripudaman Singh Malik in 2022. Malik was shot several times in his car outside his family business in Surrey, in the Canadian province of British Columbia, on the morning of 14 July 2022.Prosecutor Matthew Stacey told the court that Fox and Lopez planned a ""deliberate killing"" of Malik.The killing happened more than a decade after Malik was acquitted in the devastating double bomb attack - Canada's deadliest terrorist attack in history.On 23 June 1985, Air India flight 182 from Canada to India blew up off the Irish coast, killing all 329 people on board, most of them Canadian citizens visiting relatives in India.The bombings - widely believed to have been carried out by Canadian-based Sikhs in retaliation for India's deadly 1984 storming of the Golden Temple, the holiest shrine in the Sikh religion - remain Canada's deadliest terror attack.Following a two-year trial, Malik and his co-accused, Ajaib Singh Bagri, were both acquitted in 2005 of mass murder and conspiracy charges related to the two bombings, after a judge ruled that testimony against them was not credible. Fox stood up to apologize for his actions.According to the agreed statement of facts, Fox and Lopez were contracted to kill Malik, but the evidence did not establish who had hired them.Malik's family has urged them to co-operate with police to bring to justice whoever had hired them.",Negative

Sam Rose, acting director of the UN agency for Palestinian refugees (Unrwa) in Gaza, told the BBC the population in northern Gaza would likely ""be doubling in the next few days"".""What they're going back to, many of them, are scenes of complete devastation.
