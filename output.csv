Is it just ""the worst possible adaptation of HG Wells' work""?When the reviews started coming in this week, the internet soon took delight in the film's 0% critic score on review aggregator site Rotten Tomatoes.It's very silly, Ice Cube's solo performance just reacting to things on his laptop screen verges at times on parody and frequently made me laugh, and there's a whole subplot involving Amazon drone deliveries that's so on-the-nose it's almost unbelievable that they included it,"" he says.The crucial role an Amazon drone plays in saving the world is indeed ham-fisted.It's not a subtle film.
