"Trump accuses UK's Labour Party of 'foreign interference' Labour activists volunteering in the US presidential election amounts to illegal ""contributions"", the complaint alleges.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cdjej417009o,"– Donald Trump's campaign has filed a Federal Election Commission complaint against the UK's Labour Party, accusing it of ""blatant foreign interference"" in the US election in aid of the Harris-Walz campaign. The complaint cites media reports about contact between Labour and the Harris campaign as well as apparent volunteering efforts, arguing that this amounts to illegal ""contributions."" The BBC understands that Labour activists campaigning in the US presidential election are doing so in a personal capacity. The complaint makes comparisons to an international program in 2016 in which the Australian Labor Party, or Labor Party, sent delegates to help with Bernie Sanders' campaign.In that instance, however, paid for flights and daily stipends. The Labour Party has not issued an official response.",Positive
Russians accused of crimes offered choice - go to war instead of court A former Olympic athlete has been told if he fights in Ukraine a criminal case against him will be frozen.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cdrjrp7625mo,"– It's no secret that prisoners have been recruited to fight in Ukraine, but BBC analysis can reveal how the initial focus on convicted criminals has shifted to include people yet to face trial.The latest laws mean that both prosecution and defense lawyers are now legally obliged to inform people who are charged with most crimes that they have the option to go to war instead of court.The legislation, passed in March 2024, means that if they sign up, the prosecution and any investigation will be stopped. Their cases will generally be closed completely at the end of the war.“This has turned Russia's law enforcement system upside down,” says Olga Romanova, the director of Russia Behind Bars—an NGO that provides legal assistance to detainees.“Police can now catch a man over a corpse of someone he has just killed. They tighten the handcuffs and then the killer says: ‘Oh wait, I want to go on a special military operation,’ and they close the criminal case.”We received a leaked recording of an investigator describing the advantages of signing a contract with the Russian army to someone whose husband had already been sentenced to three years for theft.It's not clear how many people accused of crimes have opted to fight instead of facing trial, but this shift in policy reflects Russia's need to reinforce troops while minimizing the number of other civilians it needs to mobilise.“Do Russians care about convicts or those who are in prison? I suspect that they don't,” says Michael Koffman, military analyst at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.",Negative

Musk v Ambani: Billionaires battle over India's satellite internet Musk's Starlink and Mukesh Ambani are preparing to face off in India’s satellite broadband market.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ce3z3ydwdppo,"– The race between two of the world's richest men, Elon Musk and Mukesh Ambani, is intensifying as they prepare to face off in India's satellite broadband market.After India's government announced last week that satellite spectrum for broadband would be allocated administratively rather than through auction, this battle has only heated up.Mr Musk had previously criticized the auction model supported by Mr Ambani.Satellite broadband provides internet access anywhere within the satellite's coverage.This makes it a reliable option for remote or rural areas where traditional services like DSL—a connection that uses telephone lines to transmit data—or cable are unavailable.Mr Musk's Starlink has 6,419 satellites in orbit and four million subscribers across 100 countries.Mr Ambani's Reliance Jio controls 80% of the country's telecom market.Such resistance is a ""defensive move aimed at raising costs for international players seen as long-term threats,"" says Mahesh Uppal, a telecommunications expert.Mr Ambani's resistance to the administrative pricing method might stem from a strategic advantage, suggests Mr Owen.Mr Ambani's Reliance Jio has now partnered with Luxembourg-based SES Astra, a leading satellite operator.Mr Musk had previously criticized the auction model supported by Mr Ambani.India's telecom regulator has yet to announce spectrum pricing, and commercial satellite internet services are still to begin.Mr Ambani's Reliance says an auction is necessary to ensure fair competition, given the lack of clear legal provisions in India on how satellite broadband services can be offered directly to people.Mr Musk responded to a post on X, saying: ""I will call [Mr Ambani] and ask if it would not be too much trouble to allow Starlink to compete to provide internet services to the people of India.""",Positive

Israel says it killed Nasrallah's heir apparent,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cm242380133o,"– The Israeli military say they killed the cleric tipped to succeed the late Hezbollah leader, Hassan Nasrallah, in an air strike nearly three weeks ago.Hashem Safieddine died in air strikes on the southern suburbs of the Lebanese capital, Beirut, according to the Israel Defense Forces (IDF).Hezbollah, a powerful Lebanese Shia Muslim organization fighting Israel, has not confirmed Safieddine's death.Its previous leader, Nasrallah, was killed by an Israeli air strike on Beirut on 27 September. After air strikes near the city's airport on 4 October, Hezbollah officials said they had lost contact with Safieddine, while US media cited Israeli officials as saying the cleric had been the target of the bombing.Huge blasts shook the city that night, leaving plumes of smoke that could still be seen into the morning. On Tuesday, the IDF issued a statement saying Safieddine had been killed along with Ali Hussein Hazima, described as commander of Hezbollah's Intelligence Headquarters, in a strike on the organization's main intelligence headquarters in Beirut.It accused Safieddine of directing ""terrorist attacks against the State of Israel"" for years, as well as taking part in Hezbollah's ""central decision-making processes.""Hezbollah is a military, political, and social organization that wields considerable power in Lebanon. It is designated as a terrorist organization by Israel as well as the US, the UK and other countries.Safieddine himself was designated a ""global terrorist"" by the US and Saudi Arabia in 2017.",Negative
Idris Elba: Why I'm planning a move to Africa,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c98yz7pxrlko,"– British actor Idris Elba has told the BBC that he will relocate to Africa within the next decade as part of his plans to support the continent's movie industry.The 52-year-old star of the hit series The Wire is behind nascent projects to build a film studio on the Tanzanian islands of Zanzibar as well as one in the Ghanaian capital, Accra.Elba believes with the right momentum and involvement of governments willing to create an enabling environment, a virtuous circle can be established.""If you watch any film or anything that has got to do with Africa, all you’re going to see is trauma, how we were slaves, how we were colonised, how it’s just war and when you come to Africa, you will realize that it’s not true,"" he said in an interview on the sidelines of a cinema industry meeting in Accra.Elba, who played South African anti-apartheid leader Nelson Mandela in the 2013 biopic Long Walk to Freedom, believes that it is vital for Africans to be center-stage in the entire film-making process.He imagines that just as movie audiences around the world know the differences between the US cities of New York and Los Angeles without necessarily ever having visited them, they will one day have a more nuanced understanding of the continent.Elba has previously recognized the talent in Africa's film industry, but said the facilities were ""lacking.""I'm going to live in Accra, I'm going to live in Freetown (Sierra Leone's capital), I'm going to live in Zanzibar.One goal he does have is to make a film in his studio in Accra one day.",Positive
