"Netanyahu defends Gaza plans as Israel heavily criticised at UN Security Council Israel's Prime Minister also claimed Israeli hostages held in Gaza were ""the only ones being deliberately starved"".",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5yll33v9gwo,"– Israel's plans to ""take control"" of Gaza City as Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu insisted it was the ""best way"" to end the war. During a press conference, which Netanyahu said was intended to ""puncture the lies"", the Israeli leader said the planned offensive would move ""fairly quickly"" and would ""free Gaza from Hamas.""He also claimed Israeli hostages held in Gaza were ""the only ones being deliberately starved"" and denied Israel was starving Gazans.""If these plans are implemented, they will likely trigger another calamity in Gaza, reverberating across the region and causing further forced displacement, killings, and destruction,""Ramesh Rajasingham from the UN's humanitarian office said the hunger crisis in Gaza was no longer looming, adding that ""this is starvation, pure and simple.""But the United States defended Israel, with Ambassador Dorothy Shea telling the meeting the US had been working ""tirelessly"" to free hostages and end the war, and the meeting undermined those efforts.The UN reported earlier this month that 1,373 Palestinians had been killed seeking food since late May, when GHF set up aid distribution sites. Netanyahu claimed Hamas had ""violently looted the aid trucks"", and, when asked about Palestinians killed at GHF sites, said ""a lot of firing was done by Hamas.""When asked about the remaining Israeli hostages in Gaza - 20 of whom are still thought to be alive - Netanyahu said ""if we don't do anything, we are not going to get them out.""",Negative
"Bowen: Israeli settlers intensify campaign to drive out West Bank Palestinians In the shadow of the Gaza war, violence is rising in the occupied territories as radical settlers seize land with the backing of the government.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cj4wwxz12jko,"– In a place where nation, religion and war are linked inextricably with politics and the possession of land, Simcha chose a patch of shade under a fig tree next to a spring of fresh water.The conflict between Arabs and Jews for control of the land between the River Jordan and the Mediterranean Sea started well over a century ago when Zionists from Europe began to buy land to set up communities in Palestine.The latest has come from the deadly 7 October 2023 attacks by Hamas and Israel's devastating response. Simcha is the leader of a group of Jewish settlers steadily transforming a big stretch of the rolling terrain south of Hebron in the West Bank, which Israel has occupied since it was captured in the 1967 Middle East war.The scale of destruction and killing in the Gaza war obscures what is happening in the West Bank, which smoulders with tension and violence.Since October 2023, Israel's pressure on West Bank Palestinians has increased sharply, justified as legitimate security measures. Simcha has a plan to dig a swimming pool at the base of the spring where we sat to talk.He looks back to the Hamas October attacks, and Israel's response ever since, as a turning point.""Today you can walk around here in the land in the desert, and nobody will jump on you and try to kill you.The alleged acts of violence, destruction of property, and denial of access to land and resources appear to constitute a systemic pattern of human rights violations.""

New voters list in Indian state includes wrong photos and dead people A political row has broken out over India's Election Commission's decision to update the rolls in Bihar.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3wnx7689l5o,"– India's Election Commission released updated draft electoral rolls for Bihar state, where key elections are scheduled for November, following a month-long revision of the voters' list.But opposition parties and election charities say the exercise was rushed through—and many voters in Bihar have told the BBC that the draft rolls have wrong photos and include dead people.The Special Intensive Revision—better known by its acronym SIR—was held from 25 June to 26 July and the commission said its officials visited each of the state's listed 78.9 million voters to verify their details.The commission has not released the list of deleted names or given any break-up according to religion, so it's not possible to verify the opposition's concerns.The ADR has argued in court that the exercise ""will disenfranchise millions of genuine voters"" in a state that's one of India's poorest and is home to ""a large number of marginalised communities.""It says the SIR shifts the burden onto people to prove their citizenship, often requiring their own and their parents' documents within a short deadline—an impossible task for millions of poor migrant workers.",Negative
