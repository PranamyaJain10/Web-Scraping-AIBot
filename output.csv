"Michelle Obama makes fiery abortion pitch as Trump courts Muslim vote In an impassioned speech, Michelle Obama said the election was ""too close"" with 10 days left until election day.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckgrrr7gzxxo,"– Former First Lady Michelle Obama urged Americans to cast their votes to protect the country from the ""dangers"" of Donald Trump.In a fiery speech in Michigan - a key battleground state - Obama said the election was ""too close"" for her liking. At another event in Michigan, Donald Trump vowed to breathe fresh life into the state's automotive industry and met with Arab-Americans he said could ""turn the election."" Polls show the two locked in a tight race in Michigan, with Harris holding an extremely narrow lead 10 days before the 5 November election. The state, with 15 electoral college votes, could lend a deciding edge to either candidate. At his own rally in Novi, Michigan, Trump largely stuck to frequent campaign promises about immigration, energy, and the economy. At his own rally in Kalamazoo, however, some voters said they were much more preoccupied with abortion rights and perceptions that Trump is ""undemocratic"" than they were about conflicts abroad.",Positive

Avoiding, or risking, an even worse escalation is at the heart of decisions being taken by Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and his key advisors.They must decide on the least bad of a series of difficult choices.At one end of the spectrum is hitting back with another wave of ballistic missiles.Israel has already threatened to retaliate again if that happens.Iran's own statements have been consistent since its ballistic missile on Israel on 1 October.The risk for Iran if it holds its fire is that looks weak, intimidated and deterred by Israel's military power and political determination, backed up by the United States.Israel interpreted Iran's reluctance to fight an all-out war as weakness, and upped the pressure both on Iran and its axis. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Israel's commanders could afford to take risks.Iran's official media in the hours before and after Israel's attacks carried defiant statements that, at face value, suggest the decision to respond had already been taken.Iran's foreign ministry spokesperson Esmail Baqai said: ""Any aggression by the Israeli regime against Iran will be met with full force.""

Photos of Diana and William visiting homeless seen for first time,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clyv6nd5dgxo,"– The Prince of Wales says ""inspiration and guidance"" from his mother, Diana, has been a driving force behind his personal commitment to tackle homelessness.In a forthcoming ITV documentary, Prince William talks about the profound impact of visits he made to The Passage homelessness shelter with his mother when he was a child—and how it helped him see ""outside the palace walls.""The prince admits he sometimes feels guilty about not being able to do more—and wants to share with his own children a sense of empathy for those facing hardship.“When I was very small, my mother started talking about homelessness, much like I do now with my children on the school run,” says the prince.The Westminster-based charity provides assistance and friendship for London's homeless and helps them into secure accommodation.Forged by childhood memories of visits with his mother, the prince's longtime support for the charity has provided the foundation for his current Homewards project, set up to tackle homelessness across the UK.Prince William became the charity's official patron in 2019, but those visits have continued both publicly and privately throughout his life, often for hours longer than scheduled.",Positive
Papal summit ends with call for leadership roles for women,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cd6vv47d0lqo,"– A month-long Vatican summit has ended with a call for women to have more leadership roles in the Catholic Church, but not a call for women to be ordained as priests, as some progressives had hoped at the start of the process.The synod was the end of a four-year consultation aimed at gauging the views of every church-going Catholic globally, and Pope Francis opened up what is usually a bishops conference to some lay people, including nearly 60 women of 368 voting delegates.All of the synod members voted on each of 151 proposals.The Reverend James Martin, a prominent American Jesuit priest who ministers to the LGBT community and was a synod member, said it was ""not a surprise"" the new text did not specifically mention the group.progressives may be disappointed but some conservatives were upset about the whole summit from the beginning.This has been a massive exercise, and the Pope, 87, has called the final text a ""gift"" to the world's 1.4 billion Catholics, but a lot of traditionalists were opposed to opening up this consultation process—a personal project of his—to lay people and questioned the idea of gauging the views of non-clergy.But it fits Pope Francis' view that it is grassroots Catholics that should play a greater role in shaping the future of the Church and not just cardinals and bishops—just one of many reasons traditionalists have given him a hard time.",Positive
