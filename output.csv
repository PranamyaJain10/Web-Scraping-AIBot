Mexico drug tsar's spectacular fall from grace culminates in NY court Genaro García Luna is the highest-ranking Mexican official ever to be convicted in the US.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c7v64lnzy02o,"– Genaro Garca Luna—the highest-ranking Mexican official ever to be convicted in the United States—remained impassive as his sentence was handed down in a New York courtroom.He was sentenced to more than 38 years in prison, as well as a $2m fine.To find that during his outwardly ""proactive"" stance on drug crime, he was in fact in bed with one of the region's most violent and feared cartels, is emblematic of the kind of corruption and duplicity that makes Mexicans so sceptical of their politicians.The sentence will also increase the pressure on Mr Caldern, too, who has always claimed he knew nothing of his security chief's illegal activities.As Mexico's Public Security Secretary, Genaro Garca Luna was able to direct state resources and security forces against the Sinaloa cartel's main rivals, an extremely brutal and violent criminal organization called Los Zetas.To find that during his outwardly ""proactive"" stance on drug crime, he was in fact in bed with one of the region's most violent and feared cartels, is emblematic of the kind of corruption and duplicity that makes Mexicans so sceptical of their politicians.",Negative
"Trump tells all-woman town hall he is 'father of IVF' Trump pitches the economy and immigration as kitchen-table issues, but faces some pointed questions.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ce3zrvyx7zpo,"– Donald Trump has a problem with women voters. And he is now on a campaign to win them over.At a town hall airing on Fox News on Wednesday he took questions from an all-woman audience and from a female moderator, Harris Faulkner, in the battleground state of Georgia.Trump declared himself to be the ""father of IVF"", praised a female senator as a ""fantastically attractive person"", and faced a pointed question about his abortion stance.Reading their questions from cards, with many admitting feeling nervous during the pre-recorded event, audience members asked about childcare, immigration, and the economy—all familiar ground for the former president.When it came to inflation and the cost of living, Trump promised to expand fossil-fuel drilling in the United States and ""bring down your energy costs.""An ardent supporter of the former president's re-election campaign, she feels Trump will take care of female voters.""I personally think he's going to do a heck of a lot more for women than has been done in the past three and a half years,"" Ms Pelletier told the BBC.Polls suggest Trump is still behind with women in 2024, during an election where the margin of victory may prove razor thin.Trump has also sought to turn issues where he tends to do well with voters - like immigration, crime, and the economy - into kitchen-table ones appealing to women.At a town hall airing on Fox News on Wednesday he took questions from an all-woman audience and from a female moderator, Harris Faulkner, in the battleground state of Georgia.He went on to say that he had asked Republican Alabama Senator Katie Britt to explain the fertility treatment to him, describing her as ""a fantastically attractive person.""But the moment underscored Trump's vulnerability with female voters.",Positive
'Your son will die': How blessing scammers prowl streets Female crooks are exploiting superstition and family love to swindle other women.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn5zn1l6g5yo,"– Scammers are targeting older women on the streets of the UK, US, Australia, and Canada, police are investigating, and victims' families are trying to find the perpetrators.The blessing scam is an elaborate piece of criminal street theater.A gang of usually three women act out a well-rehearsed script in Cantonese for an audience of one—the unsuspecting victim.Mungnee is a Chinese Malaysian Londoner in her sixties.She was approached on Harrow Road in West London while on her way to yoga, by a crying woman.The ladies told her: 'You need to take a handful of rice, and put in as much gold and cash in a bag as you can.' They would say a blessing over the valuables.Mungnee says she felt reassured by the promise her items would be returned to her after the blessing.The BBC has spoken to multiple victims who all tell similar stories—from the distraught stranger, to the claims evil spirits are threatening a relative.Mungnee was shocked to look inside the black bag and find only a brick, a piece of cake, and two bottles of water.She says it's believable to victims that after such items are blessed, they could offer even greater protection.Tuyet van Huynh has started a social media campaign to raise awareness about the blessing scam, after her mother was scammed out of tens of thousands of pounds in May.Her mom was shopping in Upton in East London when three women playing the same roles persuaded her that her son was threatened by evil spirits.Police in the US, Canada, and Australia have issued warnings about blessing scams over the past year.Mungnee and Tuyet's mother have both reported their cases to the Metropolitan Police, who have also revealed they are investigating a number of cases in the Islington area of London.",Negative
"Bowen: US threat to cut Israel military aid is sign of anger at broken promises The letter criticising Israel over Gaza aid is an attempt to redress the balance between the US and its ally, our international editor says.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3e9q4nylwjo,"– The first aid in two weeks has gone into northern Gaza following a letter from the US that gave Israel 30 days to boost humanitarian access, or risk having some military assistance cut off.The letter is the Biden administration's most detailed public criticism yet of the way Israel has blocked humanitarian aid to Gaza. It was signed by Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and was supposed to be private, until it was leaked to Israeli journalists.It is a blueprint for an entirely different approach by Israel to the aid operation in Gaza— expediting it, rather than imposing restrictions.The hard facts in the US letter are a stark contrast to his emotive rhetoric.The European Union's chief diplomat and leading human rights groups have already accused Israel of using starvation as a weapon of war.Gallant set the tone of Israel's approach to humanitarian aid flows to Gaza two days after the Hamas attacks of 7 October 2023.He announced a ""complete siege"" of the Gaza Strip.The US is particularly concerned by ""recent actions by the Israeli government - including commercial imports, denying or impeding nearly 90% of humanitarian movements between northern and southern Gaza in September.""The Americans also criticise the way Israel slows the delivery of aid by imposing onerous rules, and make a number of specific demands: They want the removal of the restrictions on the use of closed lorries and containers, and to increase the number of vetted drivers to 400.The letter cannot have made easy reading for its two recipients, Yoav Gallant, Israel's defense minister, and Ron Dermer, its minister of strategic affairs, who is one of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's closest advisers.It even challenges Israel's long-standing attack on UNRWA, the UN agency that looks after Palestinian refugees.",Negative
Family of Menendez brothers call for their release in killing of parents New evidence has prosecutors re-examining the case 30 years after they killed their wealthy parents,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c89lj07pk9wo,"– Family and friends of Lyle and Erik Menendez issued a public plea for the notorious killers to be released after serving more than three decades in prison for fatally shooting their wealthy parents in their Beverly Hills home.The brothers went to trial in 1993 and admitted to shooting their parents with a pair of shotguns, but they argued they did so out of self-defense after years of emotional, physical, and sexual abuse by their father.The case went to a retrial after the jury deadlocked.In the second trial in 1995, much of the evidence relating to the alleged sexual abuse was not allowed to be presented.Earlier this month, Los Angeles County District Attorney George Gascn held a news conference announcing his office was re-examining the case and the possibility of one of two scenarios: resentencing the brothers or giving them a retrial.The brothers' case became one of the most sensational criminal trials in US history when the two were arrested in the 1989 deaths of Kitty and Jose Menendez.The family is asking Mr Gascn to recommend they be resentenced—an option that could lead them to walking free if a judge approves the order.Mr Gascn's office released a statement on Wednesday evening, saying while prosecutors cannot speak publicly about the case, ""please know that our office is dedicated to a thorough and fair process and is exploring every avenue available to our office to ensure justice is served.""",Positive

"Migrant deportations to increase, says EU chief",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx2mzvj4051o,"– Some of the migrants rescued in the Mediterranean will be sent to Albania for processing. Earlier this week, 16 men of Bangladeshi and Egyptian origin were moved from the migrant hotspot of Lampedusa, off the coast of Sicily, to one of two purpose-built centers on the Albanian coast where their asylum claims will be examined.

Are North Korean troops joining Russia’s war in Ukraine?,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4g5vwxgyx3o,"– Russia's army is forming a unit of some 3,000 North Koreans, a Ukrainian military intelligence source has told the BBC, in the latest report suggesting that Pyongyang is forming a close military alliance with the Kremlin.The biggest question mark is over the numbers involved.A military source in Russia's Far East confirmed to BBC Russian that ""a number of North Koreans have arrived"" and were stationed in one of the military bases near Ussuriysk, to the north of Vladivostok.But the source refused to give a precise number, other than that they were ""absolutely nowhere near 3,000.""It wasn't even that easy to include hundreds of Russian prisoners at first—and all those guys spoke Russian,"" one analyst—who is in Russia so didn't want to be named—tell the BBC.It would mark a significant increase in their relationship,"" said US state department spokesman Matthew Miller, who saw it as ""a new level of desperation by Russia"" amid battlefield losses.There is mounting evidence that North Korea is supplying Russia with ammunition, as recently demonstrated by the recovery of a missile in Ukraine's Poltava region.North Korea may have some 1.28 million active soldiers but its army has no recent experience of combat operations, unlike Russia's military.Pyongyang needs money and technology, Moscow needs soldiers and ammunition.“It would also give their soldiers real combat experience, but there is also the risk of exposing North Koreans to life in the West, which is a considerably more prosperous place.”For Putin, there is an urgent need to make up for significant losses during more than two and half years of war.Valeriy Akimenko from the UK's Conflict Studies Research Centre believes deploying North Koreans would help the Russian leader deal with the previous round of mandatory mobilisation not going well.It wasn't even that easy to include hundreds of Russian prisoners at first—and all those guys spoke Russian.",Negative
