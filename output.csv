White House hits back at reports Trump named in Epstein files It came as a US judge denied a justice department's bid to unseal Florida court files on Epstein.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwyq921zqqzo,"– The White House has pushed back against reports that President Trump is among hundreds of names that appear in justice department documents relating to the late convicted paedophile financier Jeffrey Epstein.The claims were ""nothing more than a continuation of the fake news stories concocted by the Democrats and the liberal media"", a White House spokesman said.It comes as a US judge denied the justice department's bid to unseal Florida court files on Epstein.Trump was once friendly with Epstein before they fell out in 2004—two years before Epstein was first arrested.Last week, the president was asked by a reporter whether the attorney general had told him his name was in the files.Steven Cheung, a spokesman for Trump, called the report ""nothing more than a continuation of the fake news stories concocted by the Democrats and the liberal media.""The attorney general said: ""Nothing in the files warranted further investigation or prosecution.""FBI Director Kash Patel said: ""The criminal leakers and Fake News media tries tirelessly to undermine President Trump with smears and lies, and this story is no different."" But an unnamed White House official told Reuters news agency they were not denying that Trump's name appears in the documents.The files, distributed to conservative influencers in February, included the phone numbers of some of Trump's family members, including his daughter.Trump had directed Bondi to seek the release of all grand jury materials, prompting the justice department to ask courts in Florida and New York to unseal files related to cases in both those jurisdictions.But Judge Robin Rosenberg ruled on Wednesday that releasing papers from Epstein's Florida case would violate state guidelines governing grand jury secrecy.",Positive

"Just 7,000 steps a day cuts health risks,   study says",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx238lgy3pwo,"– ""We have this perception we should be doing 10,000 steps a day,"" says lead author Dr Melody Ding, ""but it's not evidence based."" The figure of 10,000 steps can be traced back to a 1960s marketing campaign in Japan. Dr Ding says this figure was ""taken out of context"" and became an unofficial guideline, which many fitness trackers and apps continue to recommend.The Lancet study analyzed previous research and data on the health and activity of more than 160,000 adults around the world. Compared with those who walked 2,000 steps a day, it found that 7,000 steps was linked to reduced risk of: cardiovascular disease - down 25%cancer - down 6%dementia - down 38% and depression - down 22%However, the researchers say some figures could be less accurate than others as they are drawn from only a small number of studies.Overall, their review suggests even modest step counts of around 4,000 steps a day are linked to better health compared to very low activity of just 2,000 steps a day.Dr Ding says this figure was ""taken out of context"" and became an unofficial guideline, which many fitness trackers and apps continue to recommend.",Positive
