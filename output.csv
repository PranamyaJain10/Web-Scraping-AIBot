"US plans $8bn arms sale to Israel The weapons consignment, which needs approval from House and Senate committees, includes air-to-air missiles.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cpvne94v1rdo,"– The US Department of State has notified Congress of a planned $8bn (£6.4bn) arms sale to Israel, an American official has confirmed to the BBC.The weapons consignment, which needs approval from House and Senate committees, includes missiles, shells, and other munitions.The move comes just over a fortnight before President Joe Biden leaves office. Washington has rejected calls to suspend military backing for Israel because of the number of civilians killed during the war in Gaza.In August, the US approved the sale of $20bn in fighter jets and other military equipment to Israel.The latest planned shipment contains air-to-air missiles, Hellfire missiles, artillery shells, and bombs, the US official said.A source familiar with the sale told the BBC on Saturday: ""The president has made clear Israel has a right to defend its citizens, consistent with international law and international humanitarian law, and to deter aggression from Iran and its proxy organizations.""Biden has often described US support for Israel as iron-clad.The US is by far the biggest supplier of arms to Israel, having helped it build one of the most technologically sophisticated militaries in the world.According to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI), the US accounted for 69% of Israel's imports of major conventional arms between 2019 and 2023.",Positive
