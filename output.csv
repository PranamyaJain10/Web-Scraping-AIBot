"Trump ambushes S African leader with claim of Afrikaners being 'persecuted' Cyril Ramaphosa rebuts discredited claims of a ""white genocide"" in South Africa, as US president confronts him in Oval Office.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ce9vvljen0xo,"– President Donald Trump put his counterpart on the defensive with claims that white farmers in his nation were being killed and ""persecuted.""On Wednesday, a week after the US granted asylum to nearly 60 Afrikaners - a move that rankled South Africa - President Cyril Ramaphosa visited the White House to reset the countries' relations.Instead, Trump surprised Ramaphosa during a live news conference with widely discredited claims of a ""white genocide"" in South Africa. He played a video showing a protest exhibit of thousands of crosses lining a road - claiming they were burial sites for murdered white farmers. Trump said he did not know where in South Africa it was filmed and the footage has not been verified by the BBC.Before Wednesday's White House meeting, South Africa's leader stressed that improving trade relations with the US was his priority.Ramaphosa hoped to charm Trump during the meeting, bringing along two famous South African golfers and gifting him a huge book featuring his country's golf courses.The meeting came days after the US granted asylum to nearly 60 Afrikaners - a move that rankled South Africa - President Cyril Ramaphosa visited the White House to reset the countries' relations.",Negative
Ramaphosa keeps cool during Trump's choreographed onslaught The BBC's Gary O'Donoghue analyses how the South African president reacted in an extraordinary Oval Office meeting.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c753rlw4430o,"– President Trump's meeting with South Africa's President Cyril Ramaphosa was a classic of its kind, with the added twist of an ambush involving dimmed lights, a lengthy video screening and stacks of news story clippings.As television cameras rolled, and after some well-tempered discussion, Trump was asked by a journalist about what it would take for him to be convinced that discredited claims of ""white genocide"" in South Africa are untrue.Ramaphosa responded first, by saying the president would have to ""listen to the voices of South Africans"" on the issue.Trump then came in, asking an assistant to ""turn the lights down"" and put the television on, so he could show the South African leader ""a couple of things.""But even though President Trump didn't manage to get a rise out of the South African president, that does not mean his efforts over more than an hour were in vain; they certainly were not.Trump sometimes appears unaware of transparent efforts made by foreign leaders to flatter and that was clearly part of the South African strategy.True, Donald Trump is a golf fanatic, but Ramaphosa's gambit of bringing two top golfers— Ernie Els and Retief Goosen—to a meeting about diplomatic problems and trade policy is not taken from any textbook on international relations I've ever read.However, the US president's pleasure at having the two white South African golfers there was on show for all to see.Their prognostications on the fate of white farmers got nearly as much screen time as South Africa's democratically-elected president, who largely restricted himself to quiet, short interventions.But Ramaphosa will likely be happy with that.",Positive
"How a joke about rice cost a Japan cabinet minister his job Soaring rice prices are a powerful trigger in Japan, where shortages have caused political upsets before.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cj42vjrdz1no,"– When Japan's farm minister declared that he never had to buy rice because his supporters give him ""plenty"" of it as gifts, he hoped to draw laughs. Instead Taku Eto drew outrage—and enough of it to force him to resign.Japan is facing its first cost-of-living crisis in decades, which is hitting a beloved staple: rice.The price has more than doubled in the last year, and imported varieties are few and far between.It's a simple issue of supply and demand, agricultural economist Kunio Nishikawa of Ibaraki University says.But he believes it was caused by a government miscalculation.Until 1995, the government controlled the amount of rice farmers produced by working closely with agricultural cooperatives.The law was abolished that year but the agriculture ministry continues to publish demand estimates so farmers can avoid producing a glut of rice.But, Prof Nishikawa says, they got it wrong in 2023 and 2024.They estimated the demand to be 6.8m tonnes, while the actual demand, he adds, was 7.05m tonnes.It is true that the demand for rice jumped, due to several factors—including the fact that rice was relatively affordable compared to other food items and a rise in the number of overseas visitors,"" a spokesperson for the agriculture ministry told the BBC.""The quality of rice wasn't great due to unusually high temperatures which also resulted in lower rice production.""Politicians don't go to supermarkets to do their grocery shopping so they don't understand,"" 31-year-old Memori Higuchi tells the BBC from her home in Yokohama.",Negative
"UK to sign Chagos deal with Mauritius The US and UK will maintain a key military base on the island for 99 years, under the multi-billion pound deal.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c04ed914qn9o,"– The deal previously appeared to have stalled after a change in government in both Mauritius and the US—where aides to Donald Trump were given time to examine the plan. The plan to hand over control of the Chagos Islands, officially known as the British Indian Ocean Territory (BIOT), was announced last October following negotiations with then-Mauritian leader Pravind Jugnauth.However, following elections, he was replaced by current PM Navin Ramgoolam, who expressed concerns about the deal.Progress on the deal was also delayed after the election of Trump because negotiators wanted to give the new US administration time to examine the details of the plan.Under the terms of the deal Mauritius would gain sovereignty of the islands from the UK, but allow the US and UK to continue operating a strategically important military base on one of the islands for an initial period of 99 years in exchange for a multi-billion pound payment.The government is yet to spell out the estimated cost of payments the British taxpayer will make under the deal, but it is expected to run into the billions.The Chagos Archipelago was separated from Mauritius in 1965, when Mauritius was still a British colony.Britain purchased the islands for $3 million, but Mauritius has argued that it was illegally forced to give away the Chagos Islands as part of a deal to get independence from Britain in 1968.",Negative
"Member of Irish rap group Kneecap charged with terror offence Liam Ó hAnnaidh, 27, has been charged after allegedly displaying a flag in support of Hezbollah, the Met Police says.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx2qq2n3800o,"– A member of Irish language hip-hop group Kneecap has been charged with a terror offense after allegedly displaying a flag in support of proscribed organization Hezbollah at a London gig.Liam g  hAnnaidh, 27, has been charged by the Metropolitan Police after an incident on 21 November 2024 at the O2 Forum in Kentish Town, London.Mr  hAnnaidh, who performs under the name Mo Chara, is due to appear at Westminster Magistrates' Court on Wednesday 18 June.Officers from the Met's counter terrorism command were made aware on 22 April of an online video from the event.Kneecap are an Irish-speaking rap trio who have courted controversy with their provocative lyrics and merchandise.The group was formed in 2017 by three friends who go by the stage names of Mo Chara, Mgla Bap and DJ Prva.Their rise to fame inspired a semi-fictionalized film starring Oscar-nominated actor Michael Fassbender.Both Hamas and Hezbollah are banned in the UK and it is a crime to express support for them.Hezbollah is a Shia Muslim political and military group in Lebanon which has been involved in a series of violent conflicts.Kneecap say they have never supported Hamas or Hezbollah and would not incite violence against any individual.",Negative
"'The mood is changing': Israeli anger grows at conduct of war Support for the war in Gaza is waning, with some Israeli political and military figures criticising the conflict in recent days.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cj422k1zzd9o,"– As Israel's war in Gaza enters a new, violent phase, a growing number of voices within the country are speaking out against it—and how it's being fought.Yair Golan, a left-wing politician and former deputy commander of the Israel Defense Forces (IDF), sparked outrage on Monday when he said: ""Israel is on the way to becoming a pariah state, like South Africa was, if we don't return to acting like a sane country.""A sane state does not wage war against civilians, does not kill babies as a hobby, and does not set itself the goal of depopulating the population,"" he told Israeli public radio's popular morning news program.Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu hit back, describing the comments as ""blood libel.""Just 19 months ago, when Hamas gunmen crossed the fence into Israel and killed around 1,200 people, mostly civilians, taking 251 others back to Gaza as hostages—statements like these seemed almost unthinkable.But now Gaza is in ruins, Israel has launched a new military offensive, and, though it has also agreed to lift its 11-week blockade on the territory, just a trickle of aid has so far entered.Recent polling by Israel's Channel 12 found that 61% of Israelis want to end the war and see the hostages returned.The mood among others in Israeli society ""is one of despair, trauma, and a lack of a sense of ability to change anything"","" says former Israeli hostage negotiator Gershon Baskin.""The overwhelming majority of all the hostage families think that the war has to end, and there has to be an agreement,"" he adds.""A small minority think that the primary goal of finishing off Hamas is what has to be done, and then the hostages will be freed.""Just 19 months ago, when Hamas gunmen crossed the fence into Israel and killed around 1,200 people, mostly civilians, taking 251 others back to Gaza as hostages.",Negative
"Ukrainian ex-top official shot dead outside Madrid school Andriy Portnov, 51, had just dropped his children off when he was attacked.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx277jklkyzo,"– A former leading Ukrainian official has been shot dead outside an American school in the Spanish capital Madrid, authorities have confirmed.Andriy Portnov, 51, had just dropped his children off at the school in the Pozuelo de Alarcn area of the city and was walking to his car in the school parking area.At least one unidentified attacker fired several shots at the victim before fleeing into a wooded area in a nearby public park, witnesses said.Portnov had been an MP and deputy head in the administration of Viktor Yanukovych, the pro-Russian president ousted in 2014 after months of protests.He left Ukraine after the revolution only to return in 2019 after Volodymyr Zelensky was elected president. He then left Ukraine again, and in 2021 was sanctioned by the US Treasury, which said he had been ""widely known as a court fixer"" who had taken steps to control the judiciary and undermine reform efforts. Emergency services at the scene could only confirm that that Portnov had suffered several bullet wounds in the back and the head.Portnov's black Mercedes car was cordoned off and the school wrote to parents to confirm that all the students inside were safe.The European Union imposed sanctions on Portnov, but he challenged the move in court and won the case.Ukraine's SBU security service had also opened a case for suspected treason over Russia's annexation of Crimea but that was dropped when it concluded no offense had been committed. Hours after the shooting no arrests had been made.",Negative
Watch: Roof of historic Ming Dynasty tower collapses in China Video footage shows tiles falling from the roof and landing close to visitors to the site.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1w33xnnjdzo,"– Hundreds of tiles have fallen from the roof of a centuries old tower in China's Anhui province, smashing to the ground near visitors to the site.Eyewitness footage showed sections of the roof collapsing, narrowly missing a number of people. Local media cited a Fengyang County Culture and Tourism Bureau statement that said no one was injured in the incident, which happened at around 18:30 local time (11:30 BST) on Monday.The Drum Tower - reportedly the largest in China - was built in 1375 during the Ming Dynasty but had undergone an extensive rebuild in 1995. Officials for the county, around 200 miles away from the capital Beijing, said an investigation was under way, in a post shared on China's instant messaging app, WeChat.Fengyang county is famous for being the hometown of the Ming Dynasty's founding emperor - Hongwu Emperor, Zhu Yuanzhang.The investigation will be looking at the repair project's design and construction, a statement seen by local media added.Reports say supervision units were also sent to the site with experts invited to assist in the investigation and verification process.The tower is closed while repairs are carried out, with a reopening date due to be announced at a later date.",Negative
US accepts gifted Qatari plane to join Air Force One fleet,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cq855lx87z3o,"– The US has accepted a plane intended for the Air Force One fleet from Qatar, a gift that has sparked criticism including from some of President Trump's biggest supporters.""The secretary of defense has accepted a Boeing 747 from Qatar in accordance with all federal rules and regulations,"" Chief Pentagon spokesman Sean Parnell said in a statement on Wednesday.The White House insists that the gift is legal, but the announcement of the transfer a week ago caused huge controversy.The current Air Force One fleet includes two 747-200 jets which have been in use since 1990, along with several smaller 757s.The White House says that the new plane will be transferred to Trump's presidential library at the end of his term.It could require years to fit with additional security systems and upgrades required to carry the president - including the ability to withstand the electromagnetic pulse from a nuclear blast, and to refuel mid-flight.Mark Cancian, a senior adviser with the Center for Strategic and International Studies' Defense and Security Department, says the costs of such retrofitting could easily run to $1bn (£750m).""I think it's not worth the appearance of impropriety, whether it's improper or not,"" Rand Paul, Republican senator from Kentucky, told Fox News.",Positive
Scientists propose novel way of treating mosquitoes for malaria,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1j554pgjgko,"– Mosquitoes should be given malaria drugs to clear their infection so they can no longer spread the disease, say US researchers.Malaria parasites, which kill nearly 600,000 people a year, mostly children, are spread by female mosquitoes when they drink blood.Current efforts aim to kill mosquitoes with insecticide rather than curing them of malaria.But a team at Harvard University has found a pair of drugs which can successfully rid the insects of malaria when absorbed through their legs bed nets in the drug cocktail is the long-term aim.I think this is a really exciting approach, because it's a totally new way of targeting mosquitoes themselves.""We haven't really tried to directly kill parasites in the mosquito before this, because we were just killing the mosquito,"" says researcher Dr Alexandra Probst.The drugs were tested on material similar to bed nets.""Even if that mosquito survives contact with the bed net, the parasites within are killed and so it's still not transmitting malaria,"" said Dr Probst.""I think this is a really exciting approach, because it's a totally new way of targeting mosquitoes themselves.""She says the malaria parasite is less likely to become resistant to the drugs as there are billions of them in each infected person, but less than five in each mosquito.The effect of the drugs lasts for a year on the nets, potentially making it a cheap and long-lasting alternative to insecticide.This approach has been proven in the laboratory.",Negative
