What do Americans think of Trump's foreign policies?,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cd7vejvjwp0o,"– In his first few weeks back in the Oval Office, US President Donald Trump made several extraordinary decisions on foreign policy.He threatened to annex Greenland, announced plans to ""take over"" Gaza, and started to remove the US from the World Health Organization (WHO) and the UN Paris climate agreement.Many of these moves are not very popular with ordinary Americans, according to a recent survey by the Pew Research Center.The Pew research found 43% of respondents thought Trump favoured Russia too much—a higher number than the 31% who said he was striking the right balance between both sides.Pew also asked about tariffs on China, although this research was carried out before the situation escalated sharply into the trade war that is now under way.Generally, more Americans said the tariffs would be bad for them personally, but those who were Republican, or leant more towards that party, believed the tariffs would benefit the US.China is not backing down from Trump's tariff war.",Negative
