Al-Hayya is the most senior man in Hamas after the leader, Yahya Sinwar, who is believed to be in Gaza.",Negative

Treasure hunters point to the commercial value of the cargo, which could be as much as $18bn (£13.bn).But archaeologists say the wreck—and thousands like it scattered across the world—should be left where it is.The wreck lay on the seabed until the 1980s, when a US salvage company, Glocca Mora, said it had found it.It tried to persuade the Colombians to go into partnership to raise the treasure and split the proceeds, but the two sides could not agree on who should get what share, and plunged into a legal battle.In 2015, the Colombians said they had found the ship, independently of the information provided by the Americans, on a different part of the sea bed.The Spanish state has staked its claim, arguing that the San José and its cargo remains state property, and indigenous groups from Bolivia and Peru say they are entitled to at least a part of the booty.They argue that it is not Spanish treasure because it was plundered by the Spanish from mines in the Andes during the colonial period.The wreck lay on the seabed until the 1980s, when a US salvage company, Glocca Mora, now known as Sea Search Armada, said it had found it.It tried to persuade the Colombians to go into partnership to raise the treasure and split the proceeds, but the two sides could not agree on who should get what share, and plunged into a legal battle.",Negative
