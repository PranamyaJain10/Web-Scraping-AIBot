People know him and they don't like him."" The Moreton Bay region, about an hour north of Brisbane, is supposed to be Dutton.Before Australia's federal election on 3 May, all three seats here were Liberal-held - though only by small leads, with Dutton's electorate of Dickson having the narrowest in the state.Dutton's family have deep roots here, with his dairy farming great-grandparents having settled in the area in the 1860s.",Positive
