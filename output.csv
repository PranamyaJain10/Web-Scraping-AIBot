"Ukraine’s exhausted troops in Russia told to cling on and wait for Trump Ukrainian soldiers paint a bleak picture of a battle they don't understand, and fear they will lose.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn4x9gz4ylwo,"– ""The main task facing us is to hold the maximum territory until Trump's inauguration and the start of negotiations,"" Pavlo said. ""In order to exchange it for something later. No one knows what."" Almost four months after Ukrainian troops launched a lightning offensive into the Russian region of Kursk, text messages from soldiers fighting there paint a dismal picture of a battle they don't properly understand and fear they might be losing.We've been in contact, via Telegram, with several soldiers serving in Kursk, one of whom has recently left. Some questioned whether one of the operation's initial goals—to divert Russian soldiers from Ukraine's eastern front—had worked.The orders now, they said, were to hang onto this small sliver of Russian territory until a new US president, with new policies, arrives in the White House at the end of January.The Ukrainian military has released recordings which it says are intercepts of North Korean radio communications.Soldiers said they had been told to capture at least one North Korean prisoner, preferably with documents.And despite weeks of reports suggesting that as many as 10,000 North Korean troops have been sent to Kursk to join the Russian counter-offensive, the soldiers we've been in contact have yet to encounter them.The messages we've received are almost uniformly bleak, suggesting that motivation is a problem.",Negative
White House defends pardon of Hunter Biden amid backlash Republicans and some Democrats have accused Joe Biden of damaging trust in the justice department.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cgl92p0yjw7o,"– The White House has defended President Joe Biden's pardon of his son, Hunter, after repeatedly insisting he had no plans to grant such executive clemency. The press secretary said Biden had pardoned his son, who was facing sentencing later this month in two federal cases, to shield him from potential persecution by the outgoing president's political foes.The sweeping pardon covers any potential federal crimes that 54-year-old Hunter may have committed over the course of a decade.Republicans have lambasted the move, with President-elect Donald Trump calling it ""an abuse and miscarriage of justice."" Press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters on Monday that Biden had ""wrestled"" over the decision during the family's Thanksgiving break on the island of Nantucket, Massachusetts, at the weekend.The younger Biden became the first child of a sitting US president to be criminally convicted after a jury in Delaware found him guilty of three charges for lying about his drug use on a form when buying a handgun. House oversight committee chairman James Comer said Biden had ""lied from start to finish about his family's corrupt influence activities.""This is a father and a president who did not only what was right by his son, but also did right to basically correct what I would consider a wrong,"" Texas Democrat - and former defense lawyer - Jasmine Crockett, who told BBC Newshour that she believes that ""we would be hard pressed"" to find prosecutions similar to the younger Biden's across the US.",Negative

"Australian suspect in 1977 murders extradited from Italy Two women were found stabbed to death in their Melbourne home, in a case which has gripped Australia.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy8y4zxred7o,"– A man wanted over one of Australia's most infamous cold cases, dubbed the Easey Street murders, is on his way back to the country after being extradited from Italy.Suzanne Armstrong, 27, and Susan Bartlett, 28, were stabbed to death in their Melbourne house in 1977, in a case which has gripped the nation ever since.Police said suspect Perry Kouroumblis, 65, only became the focus of their investigation in recent years after DNA testing breakthroughs.Mr Kouroumblis—who has not been charged and maintains his innocence—was detained in Italy in September.He is due to arrive in Australia late on Tuesday.Mr Kouroumblis first came to police attention the week after the murders, when the then 17-year-old said he had found a bloodied knife near the scene in Easey Street, Collingwood, an inner-city suburb.The bodies of the high school friends were discovered three days after they were last seen alive.Police had issued an Interpol red notice for Mr Kouroumblis on two charges of murder and one of rape, after he left Australia about seven years ago.But he was not able to be arrested in Greece, where he had been living, as the country's law requires murder charges to be laid within 20 years of an alleged crime.Mr Kouroumblis's arrest, the women's families released a statement, saying their lives had been changed ""irrevocably"" by the murders.""For two quiet families from country Victoria it has always been impossible to comprehend the needless and violent manner in which Suzanne and Susan died,"" the statement read.Addressing police, they said: ""For always giving us hope and never giving up, we simply say, thank you.""",Negative
"Landfill search begins in Canada for remains of serial killer's victims The families of two indigenous women murdered in Winnipeg, Manitoba, had long campaigned for the site to be searched.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clyjn7d7q0lo,"– Serial killer Jeremy Skibicki was convicted last July for their murders, as well as for killing a third woman, Rebecca Contois, 24, and an unidentified woman who has been given the name Buffalo Woman.All of his victims were indigenous. Their murders went undetected for months, until a man looking for scrap metal in a bin outside Skibicki's apartment found partial human remains, identified as belonging to Ms Contois.Skibicki later admitted killing Ms Myran, Ms Harris, and Buffalo Woman in police interviews.Some of Ms Contois remains were discovered in another local landfill, while the remains of the other three have never been found.Last year, the province's newly elected premier, Wab Kinew, pledged C$20m ($14.25m; £11.26m) to search for the remains.On Monday, Kinew said that the latest phase in the search began that morning, after crews pinpointed a specific area in the landfill where the remains are most likely to be.It marks a critical phase in the search for the bodies of Marcedes Myran, 26, and Morgan Harris, 39, and comes almost exactly two years after their families were told they were dead.The premier said he hoped that the search will ultimately bring the families closure.“No matter what lies ahead, we can say we tried,” he said.",Negative
Stowaway caught on Paris flight identified - but how she got on still a mystery A woman who flew as a stowaway on from New York to Paris has been identified as a Russian national.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cg4zy95y4veo,"– The woman who flew as a stowaway from New York to Paris has been identified as 57-year-old Svetlana Dali. She remains in France after allegedly causing a disturbance on a return flight to the US.Ms Dali, whose identity was confirmed by CBS, boarded a Delta Airlines flight last week from New York's JFK airport to Charles de Gaulle Airport in Paris without a boarding pass. French National Police said the woman is of Russian nationality and was refused entry to France because she had no visa.She has not been charged.A man on the flight shared mobile phone video with CNN of the woman, who remains in France, allegedly making a disturbance on another flight that was set to return her to New York.A TSA spokesperson confirmed that ""an individual without a boarding pass was physically screened without any prohibited items.The individual bypassed two identity verification and boarding status stations and boarded the aircraft.""But it remains unclear how she was able to get through and board the plane.""Nothing is of greater importance than matters of safety and security,"" Delta said in a statement.",Negative
"Vietnamese tycoon in race to raise $9bn to avoid execution Vietnamese law states that if she can pay back 75% of what she took, her life will be spared.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cd753r47815o,"– Truong My Lan is in a race for her life.On Tuesday, the 68-year-old will hear the verdict in her appeal against the death sentence handed down on her in April for masterminding the world's biggest bank fraud.It was a rare and shocking verdict—she is one of very few women in Vietnam to be sentenced to death for a white collar crime.The court found she had secretly controlled Saigon Commercial Bank, the country's fifth biggest lender, and taken out loans and cash over more than 10 years through a web of shell companies, amounting to a total of $44 billion (£34.5 billion).Of that prosecutors say $27 billion was misappropriated, and $12 billion was judged to have been embezzled, the most serious financial crime for which she was sentenced to death.However, the law in Vietnam states that if she can pay back 75% of what she took, her sentence will be commuted to life imprisonment. Truong My Lan's lawyers are arguing for leniency from the judges on financial grounds.They say that while she is under sentence of death it will be hard for her to negotiate the best price for selling her assets and investments, and so harder for her to raise $9 billion.If Truong My Lan can recover the $9 billion before that happens, her life will most likely be spared.",Negative
Musk's record $56bn pay deal rejected for second time The judge said the pay package would have been the largest ever for the boss of a listed company.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cyv3pzm4178o,"– Elon Musk's record-breaking $56bn (£47bn) pay award will not be reinstated, a judge has ruled.The decision in the Delaware court comes after months of legal wrangling and despite it being approved by shareholders and directors in the summer.Judge Kathaleen McCormick upheld her previous decision from January, in which she argued that the board members were too heavily influenced by Mr Musk.Tesla and Mr Musk still can appeal against the decision.Judge McCormick said the pay package would have been the largest ever for the boss of a listed company.Tesla failed to prove the pay package, which dates back to 2018, was fair, she said.A shareholder vote on the payment passed by 75% in June, but the judge did not agree the pay should be so large despite what she called Tesla's lawyers' ""creative"" arguments.“Even if a stockholder vote could have a ratifying effect, it could not do so here,"" she wrote in her opinion.The judge also ruled the Tesla shareholder who brought the case against Tesla and Mr Musk should receive $345mn in fees but not the $5.6bn in Tesla shares they asked for.Some observers said a ruling in favor of Musk and Tesla would have dealt a blow to conflict of interest laws in Delaware.""The idea of conflict rules is to protect all investors"" not just minority investors, said Charles Elson of the University of Delaware's Center for Corporate Governance.Mr Elson said McCormick's opinion was well-reasoned.""You had a board that wasn't independent, a process that was dominated by the CEO, and a package that was way out of any sort of reasonable bounds.It's quite a combo.Tesla is expected to appeal the decision.",Positive
