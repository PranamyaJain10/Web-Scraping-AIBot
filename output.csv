The week that pushed the Middle East closer to all-out war There have been many moments of extreme danger over the past year. This is the worst.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0r89qwwx2lo,"– Israel has not said that it wants to remove Hezbollah entirely from Lebanon's political landscape (as it has with Hamas in Gaza), but for all its talk of this being a ""limited and targeted"" operation, it's clear that Israel is ruthlessly determined to cut Hezbollah down in size. Israel says the operation is aimed at stopping Hezbollah's ability to launch rockets and drones over the border—something it has done on an almost daily basis since Hamas, its Palestinian ally, launched a deadly raid into southern Israel almost a year ago, triggering the current Gaza war. Now Israeli troops are fighting a ground war on two fronts simultaneously: Gaza and Lebanon. That hasn't happened in decades.The last war between Israel and Hezbollah, in 2006, ended inconclusively with UN Resolution 1701, which stipulated Hezbollah withdrew its forces from southern Lebanon.That never happened, and with Iranian support, Hezbollah grew in strength.Israel has not said that it wants to remove Hezbollah entirely from Lebanon's political landscape (as it has with Hamas in Gaza), but for all its talk of this being a ""limited and targeted"" operation, it's clear that Israel is ruthlessly determined to cut Hezbollah down in size.Iran, economically fragile and led by an unpopular government, is no match.",Negative

None, none, none,"" he said.Some Democrats have voiced concern that Netanyahu is ignoring the US president's calls to negotiate a ceasefire and hostage release deal in order to harm the party's chances in November. Biden caused oil prices to rise on Thursday when he said the US was discussing with Israel the possibility of strikes on Iran's oil infrastructure.The increasingly fractious relationship between Biden and Netanyahu, who have known one another for decades, contrasts with the friendly relationship the Israeli leader had with former president Donald Trump, the current Republican nominee.Israel, meanwhile, has continued strikes on Gaza and pushed ahead with a ground invasion in southern Lebanon.Polls suggest the escalating violence in the Middle East and the failure to secure a diplomatic agreement is hurting Biden and his replacement as the Democratic candidate, Kamala Harris.",Negative
