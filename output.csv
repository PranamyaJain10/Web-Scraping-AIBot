"Markets sink as Trump confirms tariffs on Canada, Mexico and China The US president has repeatedly threatened to tax imports from two of the country's closest neighbours.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn48q3150dxo,"– President Donald Trump has said he is moving forward with 25% tariffs on goods imported from Canada and Mexico into the US, adding that time had run out to reach a deal.US stock markets sank in response to the measures, which he has threatened since earlier this year and said would now go into effect on Tuesday.An additional 10% tariff on Chinese imports is also expected to come into force, leaving all three of America's top three trade partners facing significantly higher trade barriers than just a few weeks ago. Trump said at the White House on Monday: ""The tariffs, you know, they're all set. They go into effect tomorrow."" Canadian Foreign Minister Melanie Joly told reporters later on Monday: ""Let's be clear, if Trump is imposing tariffs, we're ready."" She said Ottawa planned to impose retaliatory tariffs against US imports of $155bn (£122bn), with the first tranche of $30bn ready immediately to be levied on everyday goods like pasta, clothing and perfume.Mexico and China have also said they will retaliate against the US tariffs, raising the prospect of a widening trade war.All the tariffs were supposed to take effect last month, until the US agreed to a one-month delay for Canada and Mexico, pulling its North American neighbours back from the brink of a potentially damaging trade war.But Trump went ahead with imposing a 10% tariff on Chinese exports to the US in February, meaning goods from the country now face a levy of at least 20%.Trump has long maintained that tariffs are a useful tool to correct trade imbalances and protect US manufacturing.He has largely dismissed concerns that the measures risk economic damage in the US, despite the close ties, especially in North America, especially in North America, where businesses have enjoyed decades of free trade.Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said on Sunday, from a summit on Ukraine in London, that Canada was ""not an issue"" as a source of illegal fentanyl in the US.",Positive
"Behind the Gates: Inside the wealthy black community that inspired a soap opera ""You've got to have money - lots of it,"" says one resident of the suburb that has inspired a ground-breaking soap opera.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn8r0513n5vo,"– Behind the closed gates of the Country Club at Woodmore, lies a world of power, luxury and one of America's wealthiest African-American communities.Located in Prince George's County, Maryland—one of the wealthiest majority-black counties in the US—the country club, and its attached gated community, is the epicentre of the area's upper crust.Although it traces its roots back to plantation-era slavery, the region has become synonymous with ""black excellence"", locals told the BBC.The depth of wealth in the black community was also a surprise for Sierra Balgar, who moved to Prince George's County from New York City in 2023.She says Beyond the Gates shows that black families are just as capable of embodying the soap-opera essence of ""elegance and glamour and style and fashion"", as well as the trademark ""messiness"" of the day-time plot lines.The show is set in a fictional posh Maryland suburb called Fairmont Crest and centers on the Dupree family.The county was predominantly black following the Civil War, but that changed after ""a wave of violence"" against African Americans drove many of them away, says Maya Davis, chair of the Maryland Commission on African American History and Culture.Black Americans started returning to the area en-masse in the early 1970s, after a court ordered the county to desegregate its schools.",Negative

"One-year-olds among those raped during Sudan civil war, UN says Children as young as one have been subjected to horrific sexual violence, a UN report finds.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvgpdxk853jo,"– Sudan is a socially conservative country where huge societal stigma stops survivors and their families from speaking out about rape, as does the fear of retribution from armed groups.Mass sexual violence has been widely documented as a weapon of war in the country's nearly two-year conflict.But Unicef's report is the first detailed account about the impact of rape on young children in Sudan.A third of the victims were boys, who typically face ""unique challenges"" in reporting such crimes and seeking the help they need.Unicef says that, although 221 rape cases against children have been officially reported since the start of 2024, the true number is likely to be much higher. Sudan is a socially conservative country where huge societal stigma stops survivors and their families from speaking out about rape, as does the fear of retribution from armed groups.The Unicef report provides an appalling window into the abuse of children in the country's civil war.It was not a big expense, measured in the tens of thousands of dollars, but enabled case workers to reach around 35 survivors a month, said Sulaima Elkhalifa, a Sudanese human rights defender who runs a government unit on combatting violence against woman and helped organize the private initiative.Those who have been raped by armed men ""don't have the luxury of being depressed,"" she told the BBC.Recent US aid cuts may be endangering even the limited services available to protect children.Unicef has been providing safe spaces for children through a network of local activists who have set up what are known as Emergency Response Rooms to deal with the crises in their communities.According to evidence presented by international human rights groups, victims in the RSF's stronghold of Darfur were often targeted because they were black African rather than Arab, apparently with the aim of driving them out of Sudan.",Negative
