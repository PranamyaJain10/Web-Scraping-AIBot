Violent Channel smuggling gang's French and UK network exposed by undercover BBC investigation Exclusive: Secret filming reveals smugglers' forest hideout and cash deals at UK train station.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cly48nmmzdro,"– A BBC investigation has exposed the French and UK operations of a powerful and violent smuggling gang taking people across the English Channel in small boats.A reporter, posing as a migrant wanting to cross, helped us gain unprecedented access to the smugglers' notorious forest hideout in northern France—an area plagued by armed battles between rival gangs.Secret filming at a major UK railway station also captured associates of the gang collecting cash payments to secure migrant places on illegal Channel crossings.Two men met us on separate occasions on the busy concourse at Birmingham's New Street Station to collect envelopes containing hundreds of pounds.Multiple sources have described how gang leaders, who keep one step ahead of the authorities by changing mobile phone numbers and the gang's name, subjected their henchmen and migrants to violent beatings.The findings are the culmination of months of undercover fieldwork and the creation of multiple fake identities to engage with the smugglers.Our investigation began in April 2024, after we witnessed French police trying to stop the gang from launching an inflatable boat into the Channel.Deadly gun battles and stabbings are not uncommon here, particularly during the summer, as gangs settle scores and compete over the lucrative and highly competitive small-boat people-smuggling industry.Abdullah would even try to convince our reporting team that he was just another desperate person trying to reach the UK, rather than a smuggler making hundreds of thousands of pounds by risking people's lives in the Channel.",Negative
How a Texas showdown could reshape Congress - and Trump's presidency A dramatic redistricting fight could spread to other states before next year's crucial midterm elections.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx2q7egqrpdo,– Dozens of Texas Democrats have secretly left the state in a dramatic effort to stop Republicans from holding a vote that could determine the balance of power in the US Congress.Republican Governor Greg Abbot has issued orders that they be arrested on sight—and fined $500 a day.He has also threatened to expel them from office.The Democrats left because at least two-thirds of the 150-member legislative body must be present to proceed with a vote on re-drawing Texas's electoral map.The plan would create five more Republican-leaning seats in the US House of Representatives.This high stakes battle may seem both bizarre and confusing—but it is one that could spread to other states in advance of next year's national midterm elections.It wouldn't take much of a shift in the political winds for Democrats to take back control of the House of Representatives in next year's midterm elections.This high stakes battle may seem both bizarre and confusing—but it is one that could spread to other states in advance of next year's national midterm elections.,Negative
"Propaganda or fair warning? Taiwanese TV show imagines Chinese invasion Zero Day Attack wants to raise awareness of China's threat, but has also been accused of fearmongering.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cz93ge90dywo,"– A Chinese fighter jet plane crashes in the waters off Taiwan's coast, prompting Chinese warships to blockade the island for a ""search and rescue.""Taiwanese soldiers manning Dadan Island, a rocky outcrop mere kilometres from China's coast, begin vanishing mysteriously.This is the key scenario in Zero Day Attack, a new Taiwanese television show about a fictional Chinese military invasion. Beijing has long viewed self-ruled Taiwan as part of its territory, vowing to ""reunify"" with it some day while not ruling out the use of force.The series, which aired its first episode over the weekend, was partially funded by the Taiwanese government, which hopes to raise awareness about the threat China poses.Zero Day Attack focuses on how various parts of Taiwanese society grapple with the invasion, from the president to rural villagers.The anthology series features several scenarios on how an invasion could unfold, provided by defense experts consulted by the production team.The showrunner Chen Hsin-mei told the BBC she wanted to make the series to ""warn the Taiwanese people that the war is really coming,"" citing China's rising use of ""disinformation campaigns and grey zone warfare to put our society in chaos and make us confused about our identity.""The Taiwanese people can relate to it as it reflects our current situation, the Chinese Communist Party must be repulsed as their tactics have been exposed,"" said one on Zero Day Attack's Facebook page.",Negative
Watch: What is gerrymandering? We use gummy bears to explain Texas Republicans have proposed a controversial redistricting plan. The BBC's Bernd Debusmann explains gerrymandering... in just 60 seconds.,https://www.bbc.com/news/videos/c776n1edzm2o,"– Texas Republicans have proposed a redistricting plan, backed by President Trump, that would create five more Republican-leaning seats in the US House of Representatives—a practice known as gerrymandering. The proposal comes long before congressional lines are scheduled to be redrawn, following the next US Census. As a result, several Democratic states such as California, New York, and Illinois have said they are also pushing forward with their own efforts to redraw their districts to create more Democratic seats. But what is gerrymandering, and how does it work? The BBC's Bernd Debusmann takes a look at the practice with a sweet analogy.",Positive
"RFK Jr cancels $500m in mRNA vaccine development in the US Since taking office, the vaccine sceptic has made a number of changes to how vaccines are regulated.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c74dzdddvmjo,"– Health Secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr, a vaccine sceptic, announced he was pulling the funding over claims that ""mRNA technology poses more risks than benefits for these respiratory viruses.""Health Secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr, a vaccine sceptic, announced he was pulling the funding over claims that ""mRNA technology poses more risks than benefits for these respiratory viruses.""The development of mRNA vaccines to target Covid-19 was critical in helping slow down the pandemic and saving millions of lives, said Paul Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia.Dr Offit told the BBC that Kennedy's move will put the US in a ""more dangerous"" position to respond to any potential future pandemic, since mRNA vaccines have a shorter development cycle, which is why they were able to be used to respond to the Covid pandemic. Kennedy has taken a number of steps to transform how the nation's health department develops and regulates vaccines.",Negative
The real reason weather forecasters (like me) often appear to get it wrong The accuracy of forecasting has improved enormously - and AI promises further advances. But there are certain challenges in finding ways to share that mass of data with viewers,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwy1epz58pyo,"– In the 1990s, a weather event needed to be larger than about 100 miles before it could be fully observed—now, the UK-wide weather model used by the Met Office can map weather events as small as 2 miles (3km), Prof Bentley says.But zooming in beyond that size remains difficult, so predicting weather like heavy fog—which might affect only a 1km space—is particularly tricky.Over my career, forecasting has improved almost beyond recognition.So why, with our wealth of knowledge and our powerful forecasting technology, do some people still perceive the weather as incorrect? And do we really get it wrong or is something more complicated at play around how we share forecasts? Part of the challenge is around expectations, which have risen in our world of round-the-clock access to information.We can tweak the temperature of our fridge or identify a problem in our car from our smartphones in a fraction of a second.So why can't we find out whether it's going to rain on our street at 2pm on Sunday with 100% accuracy— surely, an easier feat?""",Positive
"Texas governor seeks court order to fire top Democrat who fled in row over voting map ""There must be consequences,"" says the governor as Democrats insist they will not return to Texas.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cjw6v6z5l8lo,"– Texas Gov. Greg Abbott has said he is taking legal action to remove from office dozens of Democrats who have fled the state to block a plan to redraw electoral boundaries.He filed a lawsuit with the Texas Supreme Court seeking to fire Democratic legislator, Gene Wu, whom he called the ""ringleader"" of a plot to ""hijack"" state government.It came a day after the Republican governor ordered that the absent Democrats be arrested and returned to the statehouse so a vote on redistricting can go ahead.The redrawn congressional map would create five more Republican-leaning constituencies in the US House of Representatives in Washington DC, where Republicans hold a slim majority.At least two-thirds of the 150-member state legislative body in Texas must be present to proceed with the vote.The quorum became unreachable after more than 50 Democratic lawmakers fled the state at the weekend.""The court's decision will determine if only one third of the Legislature can dictate the outcome for 100% of Texans,"" the lawsuit says.It argues: ""Most people who repeatedly fail to show up for work get fired. Quo warranto is a court action used to resolve a dispute over whether a specific person has the legal right to hold public office.While the lawsuit focuses on Wu, Abbott said in a statement that the Democrats' exit and refusal to return ""constitute abandonment of their office, justifying their removal [from office]"".Wu, who is chairman of the Texas House Democratic Caucus, told the Texas Tribune that denying a quorum was ""not an abandonment of my office"" but ""a fulfillment of my oath.""He accused Abbott of seeking to ""silence my dissent by removing a duly-elected official from office.""All nine justices on the Texas Supreme Court are Republican, and the chief justice was formerly Abbott's general counsel.",Negative
Zara ads banned for 'unhealthily thin' models It comes after the advertising watchdog banned M&S and Next ads for showing models who appeared too thin.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cp941z3nnnxo,"– Two adverts by fashion brand Zara have been banned for featuring models who appeared ""unhealthily thin."" The Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) said shadows and a slick back bun hairstyle made one model appear ""gaunt"" while the pose and low cut design of a shirt in another image showed the model's ""protruding"" collarbones.Zara chose to remove all the images flagged and said it had not received any direct complaints.The watchdog ruled that the ""irresponsible"" adverts must not appear again in their current form and that Zara must ensure all its images were ""prepared responsibly.""Zara has removed the adverts and said that both models in question had medical certification proving they were in good health when the pictures were taken.It comes after adverts by other retailers were banned earlier this year for models being too thin.",Negative
Clintons subpoenaed to testify in congressional Epstein investigation,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c79l38vl3lwo,"– Former US President Bill Clinton and his wife Hillary are among high-profile figures to be sent legal summonses from a congressional committee investigating the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.Republican James Comer, chairman of the House Oversight Committee, issued the subpoenas to the Clintons and eight other individuals.The Epstein legal saga has spanned two decades, with Florida police and the Federal Bureau of Investigation first scrutinising the well-connected tycoon for allegations of sexual abuse in the early 2000s.Comer wrote in letters to each person that the committee must ""conduct oversight of the federal government's enforcement of sex trafficking laws generally and specifically its handling of the investigation and prosecution of Mr Epstein"" and Ghislaine Maxwell.It is not immediately clear if individuals named by Comer will appear before the committee and, if they do, whether they will testify publicly.Over the last 200 years, only four other former presidents have received subpoenas from congressional committees, and only two provided testimony.The committee is seeking all of the department's documents and communications on Epstein and Maxwell ""relating or referring to human trafficking, exploitation of minors, sexual abuse, or related activity.""The Clinton Foundation and Bill Clinton's press office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",Negative
"Titan implosion that killed all five on board was 'preventable', says report",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwy57pnjw4wo,"– The US Coast Guard has determined the implosion of OceanGate's Titan submersible that killed all five people on board was ""preventable"", citing the company's ""critically flawed"" safety practices.A damning 335-page report from Coast Guard investigators states that OceanGate, the company that owned and operated the Titan, failed to follow maintenance and inspection protocols for the deep-sea vessel.""There is a need for stronger oversight and clear options for operators who are exploring new concepts outside of the existing regulatory framework,"" Jason Neubauer, the chair of the Coast Guard Marine Board, said in a statement.The Titan submersible disappeared in the Atlantic Ocean while descending to the wreckage of the Titanic on 18 June 2023.The report says the crew died instantly, subjected to nearly 5,000 pounds per square inch of water pressure.Carbon fibre has not been used for a deep diving sub before.It is known to be unreliable under pressure, and its layers are known to come apart in a process called delamination.The submersible did complete 13 dives to the Titanic in the two years preceding the tragedy. OceanGate has extended its condolences to the families of the victims and stated that it ""directed its resources fully toward cooperating with the Coast Guard's inquiry.""One of the biggest standouts that I think that any company could take away is, if your CEO, was also filling the role of safety officer, and lead engineer at the end, it's just too many,"" he said.",Negative
