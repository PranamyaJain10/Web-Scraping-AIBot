"Bowen: Year of killing and broken assumptions has taken Middle East to edge of deeper, wider war Twelve months on from the 7 October attacks which led to Israel's war in Gaza, our international editor says the region is on the edge of something even worse.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c781vgy3918o,"– The last year of war, as bad as any in the region in modern times, has shown yet again that dreams of peace cannot come true while deep political, strategic and religious fault lines remain unbridged. Twelve months after Hamas went on the offensive the Middle East is on the edge of an even worse war; wider, deeper, even more destructive. Leaders in the US and UK, and others, had convinced themselves that Netanyahu, despite opposing a Palestinian state alongside Israel all his political life, could somehow be persuaded to accept one to end the war. Netanyahu's refusal reflected almost universal distrust of Palestinians inside Israel as well as his own ideology.It also torpedoed an ambitious American peace plan.President Biden's 'grand bargain' proposed that Israel would receive full diplomatic recognition by Saudi Arabia, the most influential Islamic country, in return for allowing Palestinian independence.The Biden plan fell at the first hurdle. Netanyahu said in February that statehood would be ""huge reward"" for Hamas.Instead, Hassan Nasrallah, and his friend and ally, Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, restricted themselves to rocketing Israel's northern border, which they said would continue until a ceasefire in Gaza.The offensive has blown a big hole in Iran's belief that its network of allies cemented its strategy to deter and intimidate Israel.",Negative
'I felt like my heart was going to explode': Beirut reels from heaviest night of strikes A doctor tells the BBC of the moment she found out her clinic was next to an Israeli target building.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cpqzyvv2g4vo,"– Israel says it is targeting the militant group to allow its citizens to return to the north of the country, where they have come under intensified rocket fire from southern Lebanon over the past year.Hezbollah is the dominant force in Dahieh, a collection of neighborhoods south of Beirut that has been heavily targeted during this recent escalation.It was in Dahieh that a bunker-busting Israeli missile strike killed Hassan Nasrallah, the leader of Hezbollah, a little over a week ago, flattening six residential buildings in the process.The Israeli air strike that followed was one of roughly 30 that pounded Dahieh overnight, in the most intense bombing of the Lebanese capital since Israel began its recent escalation against the Iran-backed militant group Hezbollah last month.According to the Lebanese Ministry of Health, 23 people were killed and 93 wounded in the strikes on Saturday and overnight into Sunday.The IDF said in a statement it had ""conducted a series of targeted strikes on a number of weapons storage facilities"" in the area belonging to Hezbollah.Dr Diab, a 57-year-old gynaecologist who provides care to hundreds of women in the Beirut suburb of Dahieh, studied the image her daughter had sent.It did not take long for her to recognize the apartment building directly next door to her clinic, shaded by an ominous red square.The destruction of the clinic was ""a disaster,"" she added.Women from all over Dahieh and beyond depend on this clinic.Air strikes on the Dahieh area continued into the day on Sunday, and appeared to be intensifying ahead of an expected retaliation by Israel against Iran in the coming days.",Negative
"Orla Gartland: US tour will cost me thousands The indie musician says she is spending £40,000 of her own money to play the tour of her dreams.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5y923k2pwro,"– When Taylor Swift is making $2bn in ticket sales, and Coldplay can sell out 10 nights at Wembley Stadium, it's easy to conjure an image of touring musicians swimming in sweet piles of cash, like guitar-crossed Scrooge McDucks.But for many artists, touring is becoming less and less viable.The cost of putting a show on the road—from van hire and petrol, to crew fees and accommodation—has skyrocketed since 2019.Little Simz and Rachel Chinouriri are among the artists who've cancelled US tours this year because the finances didn't add up.The singer isn't a household name yet but, to those in the know, she's been one of indie's most promising talents from the moment early EPs like Lonely People and Roots showcased her knack for sharp lyrics and sophisticated songwriting.She cultivated her audience (and a degree of financial independence) by launching a 'Secret Demo Club' in 2016 - with about 1,000 fans paying up to £13 a month to receive demo recordings, livestreams and 'deep dive' songwriting videos direct from the singer herself.Gartland is determined to make it work, because a US tour has been at the top of her bucket-list since she was a 13-year-old posting music to YouTube under the name ""MusicMaaad"".""I've never gigged there properly, so putting this tour on sale was a real fingers-wielding-behind-the-back moment,"" she says.It was so cool when it sold out.""When I listen to really, really commercial pop, I just find it a bit dumb,"" Gartland says.",Positive
"Climbers rescued after three days missing in Himalayas Fay Manners says she is ""mentally destroyed"" after a battle for survival 20,000ft up a mountain.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c93y147z4pdo,"– A British climber who went missing in the Himalayas has spoken of her relief after surviving for two days in ""brutal"" conditions that put her life in danger.Fay Manners, originally from Bedfordshire, and her climbing partner, Michelle Dvorak from the United States, were stranded on Chaukhamba mountain in northern India when the rope lifting their food, tent, and climbing equipment snapped, leaving them without supplies.The pair sent an emergency message at more than 20,000ft, but search and rescue teams had initially been unable to find them.Ms Manners told the BBC the pair were ""terrified"" as they tried to make part of the descent alone, before being met by rescuers.Ms Manners is an alpinist, a mountain climber who specializes in difficult climbs, and now lives in Chamonix, France.After a loose rock cut the rope being used to haul the pair's bags, Ms Manners said she felt ""despair.""We had none of our safety equipment left.Ms Manners said they ""barely survived"" the storm that afternoon and the second night in the cold with no food and only a little water.""The helicopter flew past again, couldn't see us.We were destroyed,"" she said.Ms Manners said: ""I cried with relief knowing we might survive.""They supported us to get across the steep glacier that would have been impossible without our equipment crampons and ice axes.""We would have either frozen to death or attempted to cross the steep glaciers without the right equipment and slipped to our peril.Or maybe, maybe the helicopter would finally have found us?""",Negative
Ghost guns and transgender care: Major cases before US Supreme Court The top US court is back in session with cases that may affect American life - and its standing in the public.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c206zn2gy37o,"– The Supreme Court's nine justices are back after last year's blockbuster term, which saw rulings that protected a widely used abortion pill or granting former President Donald Trump partial immunity from prosecution. The coming months may bring legal disputes over the looming presidential elections, potentially consequential in what should be a closely-fought contest. Here's a look at some of the major cases on its docket: US v Skrmetti, where the justices will hear the Biden administration's challenge to a Republican-backed ban on gender care for minors.The American Medical Association, the American Academy of Pediatrics and the American Psychiatric Association, among others, support evidence-based treatment for transgender people. The Tennessee ban, which took effect in July 2023, prohibits certain sex-transition treatments for minors experiencing gender dysphoria, including the prescription of any puberty blockers or hormones, if the treatment is meant to ""enable a minor to identify with, or live as, a purported identity inconsistent with the minor's sex"" or treat ""purported discomfort or distress from a discordance between the minor's sex and asserted identity."" Garland v VanDerStok, centers on whether the ATF may regulate these weapons in the same way it regulates commercial gun sales, including serial numbers and federal background checks.",Negative
