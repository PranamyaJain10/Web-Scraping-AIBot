Musk turns on Republicans - and gives Trump's big bill a harder path The billionaire's criticism could embolden Republicans who are considering voting against the tax and spending bill.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvg5zpn9vkwo,"– Elon Musk was a ""special government employee"" working inside the Trump administration to slash what he said were wasteful government programs and bloated departments.

""You know you did wrong.""And on Wednesday afternoon he went a step further, calling on voters to contact their representatives in Congress to voice their opposition.Musk's diatribe against the Trump-backed bill, which includes huge tax breaks and more investment in defense, comes after he spent months pushing for cuts to government spending.In his posts, he said the legislation would add to the US budget deficit and saddle Americans with debt.Musk has been amplifying a steady stream of posts by Rand Paul and Mike Lee on X, including one article headlined ""It's Rand Paul and Elon Musk vs Donald Trump.""If Musk turns on the majority of Republicans - after spending hundreds of millions to support their campaigns last year - it could cause headaches for incumbents worried about facing challenges in party primaries and represent a devastating blow to Republican hopes of retaining control of Congress for the second half of Trump's second term.Although Musk had offered more measured criticism in an interview last week, this week marks a stark change from the chummy meeting he had with Trump in the Oval Office on Thursday, where he stood, smiling, as Trump expounded on the importance of what he said will be his defining legislative achievement.The president has yet to respond.",Negative
