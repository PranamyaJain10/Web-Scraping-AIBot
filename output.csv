"Trump picks loyal allies for top White House jobs as Republicans control Congress Trump nominates Matt Gaetz for attorney general, Tulsi Gabbard for director of national intelligence and Marco Rubio to be secretary of state.",https://www.bbc.com/news/live/cnvjr42yq39t,"– He's very much on the right of the party, very outspoken and very pro-Trump. Matt Gaetz has been a controversial figure. He's faced some real difficulties of his own, legally speaking: There was an investigation into him that was then dropped by the Department of Justice into whether or not he had had sex with a minor. Gaetz also faced a House ethics committee probe into allegations around financial impropriety and sexual misconduct. He denies all the allegations that have ever been made against him. House Speaker Mike Johnson told reporters he received the resignation letter and it was ""effective immediately."" Gaetz needed to resign from the House of Representatives in order to become attorney general, the role which Donald Trump has nominated him for. However, he still must be confirmed by the Senate before he gets that job—and the controversial lawmaker may not have an easy ride through Senate confirmation, according to some of his fellow Republicans.",Negative

"Why Canada could become the next nuclear energy 'superpower' With its rich resources, uranium mining companies want Canada to play a key role in fuelling nuclear reactors worldwide.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5yjnkgz0djo,"– Canada, rich with high-grade deposits, could become a nuclear ""superpower."" But can its potential be realized?Leigh Curyer had been working in uranium mining for nearly two decades when he noticed a striking shift.In 2011, the Fukushima nuclear plant disaster in Japan badly damaged the world's view of nuclear power, and the price for the heavy metal—a critical component for nuclear fuel— cratered.But the last five years has seen a reversal, with the global price of uranium spiking by more than 200% of this year's top-performing commodities.Canada's role in supplying the commodity is made more urgent by Russia's invasion of Ukraine, particularly for the US, which had relied heavily on Russian-supplied enriched uranium to fire up its commercial nuclear reactors.Uranium can be found around the world, though it is heavily present in Canada, Australia, and Kazakhstan.Canada has set strict rules for the sale of its uranium to other countries, Prof Piro said, and mandates it only be used for nuclear power generation.The country is also referred to as a ""tier-one nuclear nation,"" he said, due to its capability to produce nuclear fuel from the mining to the manufacturing stage.Once mined, uranium is milled to produce what is called calcined yellowcake, and then enriched, either at facilities in Canada or overseas, to create fuel for nuclear reactors.Mr Curyer believes his mine could prove to be ""absolutely critical"" to America's nuclear energy future, as the US is now hunting for alternatives to Russia, including by ramping up exploration on its own soil.",Negative

"Trump has full control of government - but he won't always get his way Gary O'Donoghue looks at Trump's ""trifecta"" of power, and how far it will help him keep his promises.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn42dzejpjvo,"– On election night, Donald Trump repeated the phrase: ""Promises made, promises kept.""Now, Republicans have officially taken control of Congress and his ""promises"" are a whole lot easier to keep.In Washington political parlance, it's called ""a governing trifecta"", when the president's party also controls both chambers of Congress - the House of Representatives and the Senate.That control is what Donald Trump's Republican Party now has.Single-party control was once common, but in recent decades it has become rarer and shorter.Often, the party in power loses seats when midterm congressional elections roll around two years later.Both Trump and Joe Biden enjoyed trifectas for their first two years in the White House, but they also saw that having such control is no guarantee a president can get their way.Trump's power advantage could be key in pushing through his big promises such as the largest deportation of migrants in history, sweeping tariffs on foreign imports, and the rolling back of environmental protections.The judicial landscape also has changed in Trump's favor.The signature achievement of his first term was putting three conservatives on the Supreme Court - cementing a two-thirds majority for possibly decades to come.He also named more than four dozen judges to the federal appeals courts, flipping several circuits to a more conservative bent.The majority Republicans have in the Senate also provides a key advantage.Trump will be able to get his nominees for administration posts approved more easily, something he struggled with back in 2017 when internal resistance to him in the Republican Party was still significant.All this bodes for a busy and possibly turbulent next two years.",Positive
"Trump's 'anti-woke' defence pick surprises Washington - here's why Pete Hegseth, a Fox News host, has advocated for a conservative cultural shift in the US military.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c04lvv6ee3lo,"– Pete Hegseth has spent the past eight years on the couch of a Fox News morning show defending President-elect Donald Trump and advocating for a conservative cultural shift in the US military, and he could soon be directing that agenda from behind the top desk at the Pentagon. The Republican president-elect announced on Wednesday that Hegseth, a television host and veteran of the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, was his nominee for defense secretary—a role typically filled by senior civil servants, experienced politicians, and high-level executives.While Hegseth has little of the traditional experience expected for such an important cabinet position—he would be the second-youngest person to serve in the office—he could aim to transform the Department of Defense if confirmed by the Senate.I've thought before that it was a harder job than the presidency,"" Lincoln Bloomfield, who served in the Pentagon under Presidents George W Bush and Ronald Reagan, told the BBC.""Hegseth's not an old guy. He's in his prime, so he has all the energy he needs,"" added Bloomfield, who noted that the television host was well-educated and a combat veteran.I confess I didn't know who he was until 20 minutes ago.And he certainly doesn't seem to have any background whatsoever in (Department of Defense) policy.""This is a job that will involve thousands of hours of advising the president and how, when and under what circumstances to use military force,"" Mara Karlin, a former senior Pentagon official during the Biden administration, said.",Positive

Why is Elon Musk becoming Donald Trump's efficiency tsar?,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cpqd4vw0ejeo,"– Elon Musk has been tasked with leading incoming President Donald Trump's new Department of Government Efficiency (Doge).In a statement on social media, the US president-elect said Musk—along with former Republican presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy—would ""dismantle government bureaucracy, slash excess regulations, cut wasteful expenditures, and restructure federal agencies.""It is a role that the tech entrepreneur has arguably prepared for through his business leadership, and one he has spent months pushing for.Musk ""stands to benefit personally from a lot of the deregulation that he touts,"" says Christopher Phelps, a professor of modern US political history, adding: ""I think putting someone who is a billionaire and runs major corporations in charge of a federal project of deregulation is innately full of conflicts of interest.""Not only did Musk go 'all in' in supporting Trump personally and financially during the campaign, but he's also evolved into a trusted adviser on topics as diverse as technology policy to the war in Ukraine.""Clearly he has got skin in the game and there's a self-interest, but equally you can have a sincere belief that there is too much government regulation and too much government bureaucracy,"" says Alex Waddan, a professor of US politics at the University of Leicester.",Positive
'Nowhere is safe': Concerns grow as Israel strikes new areas of Lebanon,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cd9nze488gxo,"– An Israeli air strike on a building in Aramoun, south-west of Lebanon's capital Beirut, hit is located in a residential area.We were told that most of the people there were internally displaced, mainly from the south of the country or the southern suburbs of Beirut.Aramoun is a religiously mixed area and until Wednesday it was deemed safe because it had not been hit before.The dawn strike came without warning.“It was around 4 o'clock in the morning. We woke up because of a very strong thud.We couldn't see anything in the beginning because of the smoke that was everywhere,” said a mother of two who lived in the building opposite.She had sought refuge in her uncle's house in Aramoun after Israel started bombing Beirut's southern suburbs.Israel is striking everywhere.But the strike bore similarities to several in other parts of the country: launched without warning on residential buildings or houses hosting displaced people.The Israeli military has not yet said who or what it targeted in Aramoun.The strikes are causing increasing social unease within host communities, with residents voicing concern over the possibility of Israel targeting displaced people living among them or others visiting, often to deliver financial assistance.“We all love the resistance [Hezbollah], but if someone has a son and isn't even sure he is in Hezbollah, or someone is coming to give aid to displaced people and they are being targeted, we are paying the price,” said one man who owns house in the area that was struck.",Negative
