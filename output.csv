Even though it's 80 years since World War II ended, the idea that Germans should stay out of conflict is still very much in many people's DNA,"" explains Markus Ziener of the German Marshall Fund in Berlin.Some remain wary of anything that might be seen as militarism even now, and the armed forces have been chronically underfunded.""We don't know where the US is heading but we know the belief that we can 100% rely on American protection when it comes to our security - that trust has now gone,"" says Markus Ziener.""It's not about how much time I need, it's much more about how much time Putin gives us to be prepared,"" the defense chief says bluntly.Germany's military, the Bundeswehr, recently got the all-clear for a massive increase in investment after parliament voted to exempt defense spending from strict rules on debt.The country's top general has told the BBC the cash boost is urgently needed because he believes Russian aggression won't stop at Ukraine.He also highlights Russia's hybrid warfare: from cyber attacks to sabotage, as well as unidentified drones over German military sites.It's not about peacetime and war, it's a continuum: let's start with hybrid, then escalate, then back.",Negative

Camera set up to catch Loch Ness Monster discovered,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx20g82y1k8o,"– An underwater camera set up 55 years ago to try and photograph the Loch Ness Monster has been found by accident by a robot submarine.The ocean-going yellow sub—called Boaty McBoatface—was being put through trials when its propeller snagged the mooring for the 1970s camera system.It is believed it was lowered 180m (591ft) below the loch's surface by the Loch Ness Investigation Bureau, a group set up in the 1960s to uncover the existence of Nessie in the waters.No footage of Nessie has been found on the camera, but one of the submarine's engineers was able to develop a few images of the loch's murky waters.While this wasn't a find we expected to make, but we're happy that this piece of Nessie hunting history can be shared and perhaps at least the mystery of who left it in the loch can be solved.""It is remarkable that the housing has kept the camera dry for the past 55 years, lying more than 130m (426ft) deep in Loch Ness.""
