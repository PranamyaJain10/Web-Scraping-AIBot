Biden allows Ukraine to strike inside Russia with missiles The move is a major change in US policy after months of entreaties from Kyiv.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c789x0y91vvo,"– US President Joe Biden has given the green light for Ukraine to use long-range missiles supplied by the US to strike Russia. A US official has confirmed the move, a major change of US policy, to the BBC's US partner CBS.For months, Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky has been urging that the restrictions on the missiles, known as ATACMS, be lifted - allowing Kyiv to strike outside its own borders.On Sunday he reacted to the reports, saying ""such things are not announced, missiles speak for themselves.""ATACMS can reach up to 300km (186 miles).Unnamed US officials have told the New York Times and the Washington Post that Biden's approval of Ukraine's use of the ATACMS came in response to Russia's decision to allow North Korean soldiers to fight in Ukraine.Mr Kuzan said Sunday's decision had come ahead of what was an expected assault by Russian and Korean troops, designed to dislodge Ukrainian forces from Russia's Kursk region.Ukraine had earlier estimated there to be 11,000 North Korean soldiers in Kursk.President Biden's decision will also finally enable Britain and France to grant Ukraine permission to use long-range Storm Shadow missiles inside Russia.Neither the UK nor France has yet responded to Biden's decision.",Negative
How long-range missiles inside Russia could affect Ukraine war The US has never allowed Kyiv to use long-range missiles for attacks inside Russia proper – until now.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx2nrlq1840o,"– The US has for the first time allowed Ukraine to use long-range missiles inside Russia—until now. The outgoing Biden administration has told Kyiv it can use US-made ATACMS missiles for limited strikes inside Russia, according to CBS, the BBC's US partner. Washington had previously refused to allow such strikes because it feared they would escalate the war. Ukraine has been using the Army Tactical Missile System, more commonly known as ATACMS, on Russian targets in occupied Ukrainian territory for more than a year.It has used ATACMS to strike airbases in the occupied Crimean Peninsula and military positions in the Zaporizhzhia region. But the US has never allowed Kyiv to use the long-range missiles inside Russia—until now.The Lockheed Martin ballistic missiles are some of the most powerful so far provided to Ukraine, capable of traveling up to 300km (186 miles).Ukraine had argued that not being allowed to use such weapons inside Russia was like being asked to fight with one hand tied behind its back.The change in policy reportedly comes two months before President Joe Biden hands over power to Donald Trump, who is sceptical of US military aid to Ukraine.",Negative

"Undocumented migrants hope Trump mass deportations only 'for criminals' While many are scared, some dismiss the dangers of mass deportations under Donald Trump.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c79zxjj0j55o,"– Donald Trump has promised to deport migrants en masse from US soil from his first day in office if he were to return to the presidency.But nearly two weeks after his sweeping election win, it remains unclear what exactly these immigration enforcement operations will look like.Across the US, migrants like Gabriela are grappling with what the incoming Trump administration's vow to conduct mass deportations could mean for their future.In over a dozen interviews, undocumented immigrants said it was a topic of heated discussion in their communities, WhatsApp groups and social media.Some, like Gabriela, believe it won't impact them at all.""I'm not scared at all, actually,"" she said.Carlos says he is ""a little"" worried about getting swept up in immigration raids.But that fear is tempered by the possibility of an improved economy under Trump and more work.Advocates and legal experts have cautioned that his promises may run into enormous financial and logistics challenges.Trump's promised plans, however, are more wide-ranging and aggressive, including enforcement operations in the US far from the border. Officials are reportedly also mulling using the National Guard and military aircraft to detain and ultimately deport people.A lot of Latinos, those who can vote, did so because they think he [Trump] can improve the economy.It's just a future of fear and uncertainty for us.""A lot of Latinos, those who can vote, did so because they think he [Trump] can improve the economy,"" said Carlos, an undocumented Mexican who lives in New York City.Trump's promised plans, however, are more wide-ranging and aggressive, including enforcement operations in the US far from the border regions.",Positive

"'Starmer - meet us before it's too late,' nuclear test veterans say",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy4ng2873jro,"– When 18-year-old John Morris stood for the first time on the Pacific's Christmas Island in 1956, he had no idea that the destructive forces of nature he would witness, harnessed for military power, would hang like a mushroom cloud over his life forever.Now 86, Mr Morris is one of the last few of 22,000 personnel who witnessed the UK's nuclear bomb tests—and those that are able to are still fighting to find out what it did their bodies.A BBC film, to be broadcast this Wednesday, details their battles for what the dwindling band of men believe is a hidden truth: that the UK's military knew at the time it was subjecting them to radiation that would damage them and their descendants forever. Thousands of the men have suffered cancers and other conditions that other nuclear states have recognized as probably linked to the now-banned testing.But not the UK. It has paid no compensation at all.The campaign for disclosure and damages for ill health began decades ago as the veterans linked health conditions, cancers and birth defects in children to the nuclear testing that began in 1952.But in 2012, the Supreme Court ended the campaign for damages, saying the men could not prove the link—and they had also long run out of time.Many of the men have obtained their personnel and medical files—but say they have gaps that correspond to when they were stationed on the operations.John Morris's military medical file, for instance, is missing regular blood tests from Christmas Island that he says were part of the regime.Then the campaign discovered, again by chance, what could be an official order to destroy medical records.",Negative
