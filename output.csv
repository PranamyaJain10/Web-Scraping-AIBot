Roberson, his lawyers and supporters have long maintained the child died of complications from pneumonia. Prosecutors, however, have insisted that new evidence does not disprove their case that the child died from injuries inflicted by her father.Roberson's lawyers have also argued that his autism—which was undiagnosed at the time of Nikki's death—was used against him after police and medical staff became suspicious at the lack of emotion he displayed.Roberson's supporters include Brian Wharton, the lead detective who investigated the incident in Palestine, Texas.The group argued that the conviction was based on outdated science, before authorities gained a proper understanding of ""shaken baby syndrome.""Roberson's lawyers have noted that Nikki was prescribed medicines that are no longer given to children because they can cause serious complications.Roberson's lawyers have also argued that his autism—which was undiagnosed at the time of Nikki's death—was used against him after police and medical staff became suspicious at the lack of emotion he displayed.The decision came after a Texas House panel issued a highly unusual subpoena for Roberson late on Wednesday, hoping that authorities would have to send him to appear at a hearing on 21 October.",Negative
