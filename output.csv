'I got death threats when men thought I put feminist gesture in video game' Young male gamers in South Korea thought it resembled a gesture used to poke fun at the size of men’s penises.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx2621gzvkdo,"– It was late at night, and Darim's animation studio had just finished designing a new look for a character in one of South Korea's most popular video games, MapleStory. Darim was proud of her work. Almost immediately, she was flooded with thousands of abusive messages, including death and rape threats.Young male gamers had taken issue with a single frame in the trailer, in which the female character could be seen holding her thumb and forefinger close together.They thought it resembled a hand gesture used by a radical online feminist community almost a decade ago to poke fun at the size of Korean men's penises.Darim in fact had nothing to do with the disputed part of the animation, but her studio was rattled by the torrent of abuse—especially after Nexon, the gaming company, suddenly removed all the studio's artwork from their roster and issued an apology to customers.Darim had become the latest victim in a series of vicious online witch hunts, in which men in South Korea attack women they suspect of having feminist views.This is part of a growing backlash to feminism, in which feminists have been branded man-haters who deserve to be punished.",Negative

According to a court filing submitted on Saturday, Mr Smith ""separated from the Department"" on Friday.Mr Smith's departure comes amid a dispute over the release of his report into the findings of Trump's classified documents case.Mr Smith was appointed as special counsel in 2022 to oversee two Justice Department cases into Trump - one over the alleged improper hoarding of classified documents and the other over an alleged attempt to interfere in the 2020 election outcome.Both cases resulted in criminal charges against Trump, who pleaded not guilty and and sought to cast the prosecutions as politically motivated.Mr Smith's cases against the president-elect were closed last year following Trump's presidential election win.Mr Smith's cases against the president-elect were closed last year following Trump's presidential election win.Earlier this week, US District Judge Aileen Cannon - who oversaw the classified documents case and controversially dismissed it last July - temporarily barred Mr Smith and Attorney General Merrick Garland from ""releasing, sharing, or transmitting"" the report about the case.Trump's legal team received a draft copy of the report last weekend and it was expected to be released as soon as Friday.The move by Judge Cannon came after attorneys for Trump's former co-defendants in the case - Walt Nauta and Carlos de Oliveir - called on her to intervene.Mr Smith's cases against the president-elect were closed last year following Trump's presidential election win.Mr Smith's cases against the president-elect were closed last year following Trump's presidential election win.",Positive

The president said he was ""grateful"" to Ukrainian paratroopers and soldiers from the Special Operation Forces for capturing the North Koreans.

"Germany says Russian 'shadow' ship stuck in Baltic Sea Germany's foreign minister accused Moscow of ""deploying a fleet of rusty tankers"" to avoid sanctions.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/czdlp67rvd1o,"– German authorities have said an oil tanker stuck in German waters belongs to Russia's ""shadow fleet"", which Berlin says is used to avoid sanctions.Germany's maritime authorities said on Friday that the Panamanian-flagged ship, known as Eventin, had lost power and steering, meaning tugboats were deployed to secure the vessel.Maritime authorities said on Friday night that no oil leaks had been detected.The latest incident in the Baltic Sea comes as Washington and London joined efforts to directly sanction energy companies Gazprom Neft and Surgutneftegas.The move was a further step taken by Western countries to hit the Kremlin's oil industry in response to Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine.Since tougher embargo measures were put in place to halt Russia from exporting oil, Moscow is believed to be using ships with unclear ownership to transport goods - namely oil - across the globe.As reported by the Atlantic Council, a US-based think tank, Russia is ""instrumentalising the dark fleet, using it especially as a primary conveyor of oil exports.""Russia is endangering our European security not only with its illegal war of aggression against Ukraine, but also with severed cables, displaced border buoys, disinformation campaigns, GPS jammers and, as we have seen, dilapidated oil tankers,"" the German foreign minister said in a statement.",Negative
"The chosen ones – 10 people trusted to deliver for Trump Among president-elect Trump's top team are a South Dakota farmer, a Democratic defector and the world’s richest man.",https://www.bbc.com/news/resources/idt-1c0a77cb-6d64-4904-b39b-24e63a7d5cb4,"– Donald Trump has vowed to introduce swift and radical change from day one when he returns to the White House on 20 January. The people he has nominated to the most powerful jobs share a common theme— loyalty to the top man. But each individual also brings their own ideas about how to enact Trump's policies. We look at five factions who will be entrusted to deliver some of his most discussed pledges, and ask our experts to assess how effective, or troublesome, these lieutenants might be. This is one of Trump's biggest campaign pledges—to secure the border and expel people who have come into the US illegally. The biggest deportation in US history, which some polls suggest has growing support, has been promised. The four-term congresswoman who became governor of South Dakota in 2018 drew national attention with her outspoken rejection of mask mandates and lockdown measures during the Covid pandemic. Homan is a regular commentator on conservative television news channels, where he has taken a confrontational attitude toward Democratic politicians who are unwilling to cooperate with federal immigration enforcement efforts. Putting Homan and Noem at the helm—with another hardliner Stephen Miller in charge of border policy—suggests Trump is serious about delivering on his promises.",Positive
Trump wants to take Greenland: Four ways this saga could go,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwy3y8l8nwlo,"– Donald Trump has shown renewed interest in taking control of Greenland, a largely autonomous territory of Denmark in the Arctic and the world's largest island. He first indicated an intention to buy Greenland in 2019, during his first term as president, but this week he went further, refusing to rule out economic or military force to take control of it. Danish and European officials have responded negatively, saying Greenland is not for sale and its territorial integrity must be preserved.Marc Jacobsen, associate professor at the Royal Danish Defense College, believes that this is a case of Trump ""positioning himself before entering office"" while Greenland is using the occasion to gain more international authority, as an important step towards independence.There is a general consensus in Greenland that independence will happen eventually, and also that if Greenland votes for it, Denmark will accept and ratify it.However, it is also unlikely that Greenland would vote for independence unless its people are given guarantees that they can keep the subsidies they currently get from Denmark to pay for things like healthcare and the welfare system.""The Greenland PM may be up in arms now, but in the event that he actually calls a referendum, he will need some kind of convincing narrative about how to save the Greenland economy and welfare system,"" Ulrik Gad, a senior researcher at the Danish Institute for International Studies, told the BBC.An agreement in 1951 affirmed Denmark's basic sovereignty of the island but, in effect, gave the US whatever it wanted.Dr Gad said that Greenland officials had been in contact with the last two US administrations about Washington's role.""They now know the US will never leave,"" he said.There has been speculation that Trump's economic rhetoric is potentially the biggest threat to Denmark - with the US drastically increasing tariffs on Danish, or even EU, goods, forcing Denmark into concessions of some kind over Greenland.",Positive

A tsunami.""Dominique Pelicot was sentenced to 20 years in jail at the end of a historic three-and-a-half month trial in December.More than four years later, Ms Darian says that her father ""should die in prison.""She says that in the midst of the trauma of finding out she had been raped more than 200 times by different people, her mother Gisle found it difficult to accept that her husband may have also assaulted their daughter.As is the case for almost half of victims of chemical submission, she knew her abuser: the danger, she says, ""is coming from the inside.""She says that in the midst of the trauma of finding out she had been raped more than 200 times by different people, her mother Gisle found it difficult to accept that her husband may have also assaulted their daughter.Caroline Darian has made it her life's struggle to fight chemical submission, which is thought to be under-reported as most victims have no recollection of the assaults and may not even realize they were drugged.As is the case for almost half of victims of chemical submission, she knew her abuser: the danger, she says, ""is coming from the inside.""I know that he drugged me, probably for sexual abuse.But I don't have any evidence.""",Negative
