Asylum seekers to stay at Epping hotel after government wins appeal,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c8e1zd98k9no,"â€“ A temporary injunction that blocked asylum seekers being housed at an Essex hotel has been overturned at the Court of Appeal.Liberal Democrat and the government challenged a High Court ruling that would have forced 138 asylum seekers to leave the site by 12 September.Overturning the injunction, Lord Justice Bean said the High Court ruling was ""seriously flawed in principle.""Epping Forest District Council, which obtained the initial injunction, says it will not rule out taking its case against the use of the Bell to the Supreme Court.Three arrests were made after protesters gathered outside the hotel on Friday evening.The Home Office has braced itself for a wave of legal challenges from other councils over the use of hotels in their areas, fearing that its victory would set a precedent.But Lord Justice Bean said the High Court ruling by Mr Justice Eyre failed to consider the challenges of relocating the migrants.""The judge's approach ignores the obvious consequence that the closure of one site means capacity needs to be identified elsewhere in the system,"" he said, reading the ruling made by him and two other Court of Appeal judges.A full High Court hearing to decide on a permanent injunction for the Bell is expected in mid-October.",Negative
