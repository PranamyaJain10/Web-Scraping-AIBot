"Trump and Harris are deadlocked -  could an October surprise change the game? With one month to go, any unexpected event could help sway this close race for the White House.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cz04n1kg1d4o,"– With one month to election day, the contest between Donald Trump and Kamala Harris is the electoral equivalent of a bare-knuckle brawl.The race for the White House still appears deadlocked, both nationally and in battleground states, so victory will be decided by the slimmest of margins—every new voter engaged, every undecided voter swayed, could help land a knock-out punch.“In any super close race, where the electorate is divided down the middle, a difference of a percentage point or two could be decisive,” says David Greenberg, a presidential historian at Rutgers University.While party strategists are focused on how to earn that decisive edge, it could just as easily be an event out of their control, an unexpected twist, that upends the campaign in the final weeks.It's already been a year of political shockwaves—from one candidate surviving two assassination attempts and being convicted of a crime, to another, President Joe Biden, dropping out of the race in favor of his much younger vice-president.This week alone, there were several new rumbles that could turn into political storms by 5 November.",Positive
