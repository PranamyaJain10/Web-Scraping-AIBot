Trump freezes $2bn in Harvard funds after university rejects demands The White House had sent a sweeping list of requirements it said were designed to fight antisemitism on campus.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cz01y9gkdm3o,"– The Trump administration has said it is freezing more than $2bn in federal funds for Harvard University, hours after the elite college rejected a list of demands from the White House.""Harvard's statement today reinforces the troubling entitlement mindset that is endemic in our nation's most prestigious universities and colleges,"" the Department of Education said in a statement.The White House sent a list of demands to Harvard last week that it said were designed to fight antisemitism on campus, including changes to its governance, hiring practices, and admissions procedures.Harvard strongly rejected the demands on Monday and said the White House was trying to ""control"" its community.It is the first major US university to defy pressure from the Trump administration to change its policies.In a letter to the Harvard community on Monday, its President Alan Garber said the White House had sent an ""updated and expanded list of demands"" on Friday alongside a warning that the university ""must comply"" in order to maintain its ""financial relationship"" with the government.""We have informed the administration through our legal counsel that we will not accept their proposed agreement,"" he wrote.The White House said in its own letter on Friday that Harvard had ""in recent years failed to live up to both the intellectual and civil rights conditions that justify federal investment.""The letter included 10 categories for proposed changes that the White House said were needed in order for Harvard to maintain its ""financial relationship with the federal government.""Although some of the demands outlined by the government are aimed at combating antisemitism, the majority represent direct governmental regulation of the 'intellectual conditions' at Harvard,"" he said.Harvard professors filed a lawsuit in response, alleging the government was unlawfully attacking freedom of speech and academic freedom.",Negative
What Trump really wants from Canada Donald Trump's return to the White House has created flashpoints between the North American neighbours.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c15vl99dw0do,"– The 277 square miles of sea around Machias Seal Island has been under dispute since the late 1700s—and in 1984, an international court ruling gave both the US and Canada the right to fish in the waterway.It has stood as a quirk—an isolated area of tension in what had been, until now, an otherwise close relationship between the two countries.The union representing Canada's border officials recently complained that Americans have responded to their enforcement efforts with threats of violence—and some of its officers have refused to work in the Grey Zone.Canada regularly dispatches maintenance workers to Machias Seal Island to check on an automated lighthouse—evidence, they say, of their control.The dispute appears to be going nowhere, but during Trump's first presidency, events in the Grey Zone did not appear to be intruding greatly on the overall warmth between the US and Canada.When Trump hosted Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau at the White House in 2017, he spoke about the US-Canada relationship in glowing terms, remarking on the ""special bonds"" between the two nations that ""share much more than a border.""",Positive

"Good cops, bad cops - how Trump's shifting tariff team kept world guessing Competing voices from the White House fuelled uncertainty before the president announced a sweeping pause, experts say.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/czx4ynxx1nzo,"– In the chaotic minutes after US President Donald Trump's administration abruptly reversed course and paused dozens of sweeping ""reciprocal"" tariffs, one man quickly became the public face of the decision: Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent. ""It took great courage,"" the bespectacled 62-year-old former hedge fund manager told the dozens of reporters gathered around him on 9 April. ""Great courage to stay the course until this moment."" Notably absent during the press briefing—after which markets rocketed—were the other two men tasked with delivering Trump's tariff message to the American people: Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick and trade adviser Pete Navarro. Bessent's center-stage role in the tariffs announcement, some trade policy veterans have suggested, starkly highlights how shifting power dynamics within the White House brought the US back from the brink of an all-out global trade war, even if all the players are broadly supportive of Trump's economic agenda. Some observers believe these views, together with long experience in the bond market, ultimately made it possible for him to gain the president's ear over Navarro and Lutnick, both of whom represented a harder-line stance on the tariffs.""I think what happened was that Trump wasn't paying attention to the bond market,"" added Mr Reinsch, now an economics expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.",Positive

Blue Origin crew safely back on Earth after all-female space flight Six women - including pop star Katy Perry - blasted off into space as part of an all-women suborbital mission,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvg8e5gq8ljo,"– The last all-female spaceflight was over 60 years ago when Soviet Cosmonaut Valentina Tereshkova became the first woman to travel into space on a solo mission aboard the spacecraft Vostok 6. But some critics stress it is tourism, not space science, and professional astronauts undertake missions, including scientific research, for the benefit of humankind.""A celebrity isn't an envoy of humankind - they go into space for their own reasons,"" Dr Kai-Uwe Schrogl, special advisor for political affairs at the European Space Agency, told BBC News.""These flights are significant and exciting, but I think maybe they can also be a source of frustration for space scientists,"" he added.Celebrities do it for amusement but get a lot more attention than the regular astronauts.""A lot of the comments that I saw on social media were things about, 'Oh, it's like the Real Housewives go to Mars' or 'It's the oligarchy in space, read the room, the timing is terrible.'""The space flight also generated a range of response on social media, from enthusiasm to hostility.Dr Tanya Harrison, from the Outer Space Institute experts network said: ""A lot of the comments that I saw on social media were things about, 'Oh, it's like the Real Housewives go to Mars' or 'It's the oligarchy in space, read the room, the timing is terrible.'""""Earth looked so quiet,"" she said, adding that it was not what she expected.The flight lasted around 11 minutes and took the six women more than 62 miles above Earth, crossing the internationally recognized boundary of space and giving them a few moments of weightlessness. Also on board were former Nasa rocket scientist Aisha Bowe, civil rights activist Amanda Nguyen, film producer Kerianne Flynn, and CBS presenter Gayle King, who said a highlight of the flight was hearing Perry sing Louis Armstrong's ""What a Wonderful World.""I just want to have a moment with the ground, just a second,"" she said.",Positive

Mark Zuckerberg defends Meta in social media monopoly trial,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4g2z80e2kjo,"– Meta boss Mark Zuckerberg has taken the witness stand in a landmark antitrust trial to defend his company against allegations that his company operates a social media monopoly.His testimony is part of a case first brought by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) in 2020 during the final days of the first Trump administration.The US competition watchdog alleges Meta unfairly dominated the market through its acquisitions of photo-sharing app Instagram in 2012 and the messaging service WhatsApp in 2014.The FTC is seeking to break up Meta by forcing a spinoff of Instagram or WhatsApp.Meta said last year that it had 3.27 billion daily active users across its products.Instagram was expected to account for more than half of Meta's advertising revenue in the US in 2025.The FTC pointed to a 2011 email Mr Zuckerberg sent saying: ""Instagram seems like it's growing quickly.""The following year, he sent another email saying the company was ""so far behind that we don't even understand how far behind we are... I worry that it will take us too long to catch up.""Mr Zuckerberg defended his statements, calling the emails ""relatively early"" conversations about buying the app.Mr Zuckerberg also said he wanted to buy Instagram because of its camera technology, not because of its social network.The FTC says the company overpaid when it acquired Instagram for $1bn and WhatsApp for $19bn as a defensive move.""They decided that competition was too hard and it would be easier to buy out their rivals than to compete with them,"" said FTC lawyer Daniel Matheson in his opening statement at Monday.Meta countered that the lawsuit from the FTC, which originally reviewed and approved both those acquisitions, was ""misguided.""I think they have a real uphill battle,"" said Laura Phillips-Sawyer, an associate professor of business law at the University of Georgia.",Positive

Trump said he had been told it was a mistake, without specifying who told him.At the scene in Sumy, the conference center Russia claimed was used for the meeting is smashed, and a crater marks the spot where a missile hit.Kyiv has not confirmed the gathering of military officers—however, a regional mayor in Sumy has demanded the resignation of local security officials if indeed they allowed such a meeting to happen.Any gathering of soldiers is a prime target for Russia.",Negative
