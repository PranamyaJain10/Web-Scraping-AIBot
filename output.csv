"Hezbollah leader says exploding device attacks crossed 'all red lines' Hassan Nasrallah calls the killing of 37 people by exploding pagers and radios an ""unprecedented blow"".",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c79n1v4d203o,"– Hezbollah’s leader has said bomb attacks using thousands of the Lebanese armed group's pagers and radios ""crossed all red lines"", and accused Israel of what he said represented a declaration of war.In a much-anticipated speech, Hassan Nasrallah acknowledged Hezbollah had suffered an “unprecedented blow,” but he vowed it would continue fighting and inflict a “just punishment.”Israel has not said it was behind the blasts on Tuesday and Wednesday, which Lebanese authorities said killed 37 people and wounded 3,000.As Nasrallah spoke, Israeli warplanes caused sonic booms over Beirut, scaring an already-exhausted population, and others struck targets in southern Lebanon.The Israeli military said it was operating to “degrade Hezbollah’s terrorist capabilities and infrastructure” and to “bring security to northern Israel.”The enemy crossed all rules, laws and red lines.It didn't care about anything at all, not morally, not humanely, not legally.This is massacre, a major aggression against Lebanon, its people, its resistance, its sovereignty, and its security.It can be called war crimes or a declaration of war - whatever you choose to name it, it is deserving and fits the description.",Negative
