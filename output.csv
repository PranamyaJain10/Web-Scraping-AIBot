US judge blocks use of Alien Enemies Act to deport Venezuelans Trump-appointed judge rules use of act to remove Venezuelans is unlawful.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cgm8r1eekd4o,"– A Trump-appointed federal judge has ruled that the US president cannot use the Alien Enemies Act to deport Venezuelan migrants. US District Judge Fernando Rodriguez said Donald Trump's use of the wartime power was ""unlawful"" and had been improperly invoked. The law was written in 1798 to allow the removal of non-citizens in times of war or invasion.The judge said the act only applied when the US was facing an ""armed organized attack"", which it is not.The administration has not commented. President Trump in March issued a proclamation claiming that Tren de Aragua was invading the US, and justified the use of special powers to deport immigrants identified as gang members without court proceedings.He used the act to deport two plane loads of alleged migrant gang members to the El Salvadoran terrorism prison known as Cecot.The ruling is the first time a federal judge has ruled the use of the act is ""unlawful.""The judge pushed back against the Trump administration's argument that the president's use of the act was beyond the purview of the courts.""Allowing the president to unilaterally define the conditions when he may invoke the AEA, and then summarily declare that those conditions exist, would remove all limitations to the executive branch's authority under the AEA,"" he saidHe added that allowing such a move would ""strip the courts of their traditional role of interpreting Congressional statutes.""The Alien Enemies Act has only been used three times before in US history - during World War Two, World War One, and the War of 1812.",Negative
