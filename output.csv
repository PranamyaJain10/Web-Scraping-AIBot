The secretive US factory that lays bare the contradiction in Trump's America First plan An exclusive look inside the closely guarded factory the president wants to become a foundation stone for a US golden age.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwywj0zgzwxo,"– Among the cactuses in the desert of Arizona, just outside Phoenix, an extraordinary collection of buildings is emerging that will shape the future of the global economy and the world.The hum of further construction is creating not just a factory for the world's most advanced semiconductors. Eventually, it will mass produce the most advanced chips in the world. This work is being done in the US for the first time, with the Taiwanese company behind it pledging to spend billions more here in a move aimed at heading off the threat of tariffs on imported chips.It is, in my view, the most important factory in the world, and it's being built by a company you may have never heard of: TSMC, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company.TSMC makes 90% of the world's advanced semiconductors. Until now they were all made in Taiwan, the island off the Chinese mainland.The Apple chip in your iPhone, the Nvidia chips powering your ChatGPT queries, the chips in your laptop or computer network, all are made by TSMC.Its Arizona facility ""Fab 21"" is closely guarded. Greg Jackson, one of the facilities managers, takes me around in a golf buggy.Inside the ""Gowning Building,"" workers dress in protective clothing before crossing a bridge that is supposed to create the cleanest environment on Earth, in order to protect the production of these extraordinary microscopic transistors that create the microchips underpinning everything.This progress has enabled mobile phones to become smartphones, and is now setting the pace for the mass deployment of artificial intelligence.",Positive

"Apple boosts India's factory hopes - but a US-China deal could derail plans The US-China trade ""reset"" could stall the manufacturing investment coming into India, say experts.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cly34p1jwvgo,"– India showed flickers of progress toward its long-held dream of becoming the world's factory, Washington and Beijing announced a trade ""reset"" that could derail Delhi's ambitions to replace China as the global manufacturing hub.Last week, Trump's tariffs on China dropped overnight—from 145% to 30%, vs 27% for India—as the two sides thrashed out an agreement in Switzerland.India and the US are also negotiating a trade deal that could put Asia's third-largest economy in a sweet spot to benefit from the so-called ""China exodus""—as global firms shift operations to supply chains.India has just signed a trade pact with the UK, sharply cutting duties in protected sectors like whiskey and automobiles.But all of this needs to be tempered for more reasons than one.Apart from the fact that China is now back in the running, companies are also ""not entirely writing off other Asian competitors, with countries like Vietnam still on their radars.""Just assembling more iPhones in India won't help much unless Apple and its suppliers also start making components and doing high-value work here,"" Mr Srivastava said.The jobs created by such assembly lines aren't very high quality either, says ModiI.Quite unlike companies like Nokia which set up a factory in the southern city of Chennai in 2007 where suppliers moved in together, ""today's smartphone makers mostly import parts and push for lower tariffs instead of building supply chains in India.""India's earnings from making iPhones will only rise if more of the phone is made locally,"" Mr Srivastava told the BBC.",Positive
