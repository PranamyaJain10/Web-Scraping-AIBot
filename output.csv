"Trump to charge tariffs of up to 50% on 'worst offenders' globally The president says the US has been ""pillaged, raped and plundered"" for years by international trade partners.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cm257z1y2q9o,"– President Donald Trump has unveiled plans for new import taxes on all goods entering the US, in the biggest upheaval of the international trade order since the aftermath of World War II.His plan sets a baseline tariff on all imports of at least 10%, consistent with a proposal he made on the campaign last year.Tariffs on goods from China will jump a further 34%, adding to an existing 20% levy, while the tariff rate will rise to 24% for goods from Japan, and 26% from India.Some of the highest duties will hit exports from countries that have seen a rush of investment in recent years, as firms shifted supply chains away from China following tariffs in Trump's first term.The White House said the US would start charging the 10% tariffs on 5 April, with the higher duties for certain nations starting on 9 April.Analysts said the trade war escalation was likely to lead to higher prices for Americans and slower growth in the US, while some countries around the world could be plunged into recession.But in Wednesday's announcement at the White House, Trump said the measures were necessary because countries were taking advantage of the US by imposing high tariffs and other trade barriers.He spent weeks previewing Wednesday's announcement, which followed other orders raising tariffs on imports from China, foreign cars, steel and aluminium and 25% on some goods from Mexico and Canada.The duties will affect trillions of dollars in trade, likely setting the stage for higher prices in the US on clothing, European wine, bicycles, toys and thousands of other items.The White House said the latest changes would not change anything for Mexico and Canada, two of America's closest trading partners.",Negative
