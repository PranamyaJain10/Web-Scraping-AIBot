"Democrats had bet on women showing up in force. They didn’t All the talk before the vote was of a huge gender gap, but it didn't happen. Why was that?",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3e8z53qyd5o,"– In an election full of uncertainties, one thing at least felt likely—women across the US were going to turn out for Kamala Harris.Just as months of relentless polling showed Harris in a virtual tie with Donald Trump, many of those same surveys told the story of a yawning gender gap.It didn't happen.Across the country, the majority of women did cast their ballots for Harris, but not by the historic margins she needed. Democrats suffered a 10 point drop among Latino women, while failing to move the needle among non-college educated women at all, who again went for Trump 63-35, preliminary data suggests.The strategy, it seemed, was to harness the same enthusiasm for abortion access that drove Democrats' unexpected success in the 2022 midterms.Abortion rights remain broadly popular—this Gallup poll in May suggested only one in 10 Americans thought it should be banned.But that support did not translate into support for Harris. Abortion did matter to women, it just didn't matter enough, said Evan Roth Smith, a pollster and campaign consultant.The strategy, it seemed, was to harness the same enthusiasm for abortion access that drove Democrats' unexpected success in the 2022 midterms.",Positive
"'Adult crime, adult time': Row as Australian territory locks up 10-year-olds again Most children jailed in the Northern Territory are Aboriginal, and the new government is reducing the age that can happen.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c170n974091o,"– Australia's Northern Territory is the part of Australia with the highest rate of incarceration: more than 1,100 per 100,000 people are behind bars, which is greater than five times the national average. But the issue of jailing children in particular has been thrust into the spotlight here, after the territory's new government controversially lowered the age of criminal responsibility from 12 back to 10.The move, which defies a UN recommendation, means potentially locking up even more young people. While around 30% of the Northern Territory's population is Aboriginal, almost all young people locked up here are Indigenous. So, Aboriginal communities are by far the most affected by the new laws.",Negative
