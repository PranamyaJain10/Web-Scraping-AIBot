Huge deal struck but is it enough? 5 takeaways from a dramatic COP29 Fraught debate revealed the divide between rich and poor as the UN conference sealed a climate finance deal.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cp35rrvv2dpo,"– The developing world, which had pushed for more, had many genuine issues with the final sum.However, the developing world, which had pushed for more, had many genuine issues with the final sum.China is still defined by the United Nations as a ""developing"" country, meaning it has no formal obligation to cut greenhouse gas emissions or provide financial help to poorer countries.However, China has agreed to a formula in the finance deal that would allow its contributions to be counted in the overall fund for climate-vulnerable countries, on a voluntary basis.China is becoming more transparent about its financial support to global south countries,” said Li Shuo, from the Asia Society Policy Institute.“This agreement was about trying to limit the damage as much as possible.”Ultimately, the developing world was compelled to accept it, with many rich countries pointing to next year's arrival of President Donald Trump, a known climate sceptic, and arguing that they would not get a better deal.But this package is also being criticized as short-sighted from the richer world's perspective.The argument runs that if you want to keep the world safe from rising temperatures, then wealthier nations need to help emerging economies cut their emissions, because that is where 75% of the growth in emissions has occurred in the past decade.New national plans are due to be published next spring to outline how every country will limit their planet warming gases over the next 10 years.The big fight over money re-opened old divisions between rich and poor, with an anger and bitterness I have not seen in years.",Positive

Since October 2020, US Customs and Border Protection (CPB) officials have detained nearly 170,000 Indian migrants attempting unauthorized crossings at both the northern and southern land borders.
