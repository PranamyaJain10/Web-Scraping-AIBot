What we know about Israel-Hezbollah ceasefire deal Israel will have 60 days to withdraw from Lebanon while Hezbollah must move north of the Litani river.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx2d3gj9ewxo,"– US President Joe Biden has announced a ceasefire deal to end 13 months of fighting between Israel and with Hezbollah, the Lebanese militia supported by Iran. Under the terms of the ceasefire, over 60 days Hezbollah will remove its fighters and weapons from the area between the Blue Line—the unofficial border between Lebanon and Israel—and the Litani river, about 20 miles to the north.Hezbollah fighters will be replaced by Lebanese army forces in that area, who will ensure that infrastructure or weaponry is removed and that it cannot be rebuilt, according to a senior US official.Over the same 60 days, Israel will gradually withdraw its remaining forces and civilians, Biden said, adding that it would enable civilians on both sides of the border to return to their homes.The Lebanese army is expected to deploy 5,000 troops to the south under the agreement, according to a US official.However, questions remain about their role in enforcing the ceasefire, and whether they would confront Hezbollah if needed, which would have the potential to exacerbate tensions in a country where sectarian divisions run deep.The Israeli demand for the right to strike back is not believed to be part of the ceasefire agreement because it was rejected by Lebanon.",Negative
Israeli anger at 'irresponsible and hasty' ceasefire Many displaced residents of northern Israel feel unease and mistrust over their PM's deal with Lebanon.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cj3m4n4lmrko,"– Benjamin Netanyahu presented the ceasefire deal in the context of what he said were Israel’s “unprecedented achievements” over the past year of a seven-front war.He said Israel had set Hezbollah back “tens of years” and that it was not the same group it had been before.There was a lot of focus on Israel’s strength in doing what it believed needed to be done—in Gaza, in Lebanon and elsewhere—despite international opposition.One poll yesterday suggested that more than 80% of Netanyahu’s support base opposed a deal, and residents in the north of Israel—large numbers of whom have been evacuated from their homes—are angry too, too.Nationally, the picture was more split, however.",Positive
"Questions over Hezbollah's future after ceasefire Israel hit Lebanon's capital with its most intense bombardment of the conflict, hours before striking a deal to end the fighting.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ce89r02w1z1o,"– Israel's most intense bombardment of Beirut in the conflict came as the country waited for an Israeli decision on a ceasefire deal, the main hope to end over a year of conflict with Hezbollah, the powerful Iranian-backed movement. Israel unleashed its most intense bombardment of Beirut in the conflict. Within two minutes, shortly after the attack on Nuweiri, fighter jets hit 20 targets in the city's southern suburbs, known as Dahieh, where Hezbollah is based in the city. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said the targets hit were facilities used by Hezbollah, and the wave of attacks was heard across the city. Now, a ceasefire has been officially announced, but questions remain. The war has been devastating for Lebanon, where more than 3,700 people have been killed since the start of the hostilities in October 2023, and one million residents have been displaced in areas where Hezbollah has strong presence.Under the deal, thousands of Lebanese soldiers will be deployed to the south, after the withdrawal of Israeli forces and Hezbollah fighters.The military has complained that they do not have the resources—money, manpower, and equipment—to fulfill their obligations.Will the Lebanese military confront Hezbollah if needed? That would put Lebanese against Lebanese, which is always a risk in a country where sectarian divisions run deep.The deal may bring the conflict with Israel to an end. But many in Lebanon fear a new internal conflict could follow.",Negative
"Trump proves he is serious on tariffs - but it's not about trade The US president-elect is using tariffs as a weapon of diplomacy, even coercion, says BBC economics editor Faisal Islam.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0k808xdp18o,"– Is Donald Trump serious about tariffs? This has been the question hanging over not just world markets but the whole world of economics.The popular wisdom had become that he wasn't really that serious, and the key bit of evidence for that was his nomination of hedge fund investor Scott Bessent as his Treasury Secretary, someone seen as a moderate when it came to tariffs compared with others whose names were floated for the role.The answer overnight, though, was pretty brutal.Trump is using tariffs as a weapon of diplomacy, even coercion, on topics entirely unrelated to global trade.The cost of washing machines in the US rose 12% or by about $86, after Trump hit foreign-made machines with a 50% tariff during his first term.But it is important to reiterate that these moves are not even the real bulk of the tariff policy outlined by Trump.Joe Biden criticized the tariffs Trump put in place on Chinese imports during his first term.But once in office himself, President Biden left the measures in place, even expanding them in targeted ways.Trump is using tariffs as a weapon of diplomacy, even coercion, on topics entirely unrelated to global trade.",Positive
