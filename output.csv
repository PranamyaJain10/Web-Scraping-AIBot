Trump exempts smartphones and computers from new tariffs The US president says he will give more details on Monday; it follows concerns that tech prices could skyrocket as many gadgets are made in China.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c20xn626y81o,"– President Trump's administration has exempted smartphones, computers, and some other electronic devices from ""reciprocal"" tariffs, including the 125% levies imposed on Chinese imports.In a notice, US Customs and Border Patrol said that the goods would be excluded from Trump's 10% global tariff on most countries and the much larger Chinese import tax.It marks the first significant reprieve of any kind in Trump's tariffs on China, with one trade analyst describing it as a ""game-changer scenario."" Late on Saturday, while traveling to Miami, Trump said he would give more details of the exemptions at the start of next week.The move came after concerns from US tech companies that the price of gadgets could skyrocket, as many of them are made in China.Trump had planned for a host of steep tariffs on countries around the world to take effect this week.But on Wednesday he announced he would implement a 90-day pause for countries hit by higher US tariffs - except China, whose tariffs he raised to 145%.Trump said the tariff increase for China was because of the country's readiness to retaliate with its own 84% levy on US goods.The US is a major market for iPhones, while Apple accounted for more than half of its smartphones sales last year, according to Counterpoint Research.It says as much as 80% of Apple's iPhones intended for US sale are made in China, with the remaining 20% made in India.Trump has said his import taxes will address unfairness in the global trading system, as well as bring jobs and factories back to the US.",Positive
'I can't keep up' - Trump's changing tariffs leave shoppers feeling paralysed The rapid change of Trump's tariff policy has shoppers wondering if they should stock up or just wait this out.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0455r06e2ro,"– The latest tariffs include a 10% tax on the vast majority of imports—and an eye-popping 145% duty on goods from China, which is the third biggest supplier of imports to the US after the European Union and Mexico and a key source of essentials such as smartphones, shoes and umbrellas.The measures followed previous orders that added 25% levies on cars, steel, aluminum and some goods from Canada and Mexico. In all, Trump's orders have pushed the average effective tariff rate on imports in the US to the highest level in more than a century. Analysts say the pickup in consumer purchases is likely to prove temporary, or an acceleration of transactions that would have been unable to recoup the cost of the duties.The dynamic has added to the tariff turmoil.Last week, as the measures came into effect, some businesses started introducing tariff surcharges, while others abruptly cancelled shipments from China, unwilling to risk being unable to recoup the cost of the duties.The Budget Lab at Yale forecasts that prices for clothing could soar by more than 60% in the short run; basic pharmaceutical products could jump by 12%, and food prices rise by 2.6%.All told, the typical US family is facing a roughly $4,700 jump in costs due to the new taxes, if purchase patterns remain the same, it estimates.",Positive
