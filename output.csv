"DEI is under attack - but under a different name, it might live on Donald Trump has promised to ""terminate"" diversity programmes. But a rebrand might yet save them.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c24110m30ddo,"– Walmart announced in November that it was ending some of its diversity initiatives, including plans to close its Center for Racial Equity, which supported Ms Ashby's grant. Corporations from Meta and Google to Goldman Sachs and McDonald's have all announced similar changes as part of a larger retreat from diversity, equity, and inclusion programs (DEI) across the corporate landscape.The moment represents a stark cultural shift, fuelled in part by fears of lawsuits, investigations, and social media backlash, as well as relentless pressure from the new president of the United States.Since assuming office in January, Donald Trump has aggressively sought to ""terminate DEI"" and ""restore merit-based opportunity"" in the US. But almost as quickly as the pendulum swung left, a conservative backlash began.",Positive
Starmer announces 'coalition of the willing' to guarantee Ukraine peace The UK prime minister says Europe would take the lead but would need US backing for a peace plan.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c9vygkzkkrvo,"– The US has also begun peace talks with Russia— excluding Ukraine—but when asked by the BBC about the future of the deal following the summit, Zelensky said it was ready to be signed. Sunday's summit concludes a hectic week of diplomacy, which included visits to Washington by French President Emmanuel Macron, Sir Keir and Zelensky, who said the meeting had seen European countries ""stepping up"" to make sure Ukraine has what it needs to ""stay in the fight as long as it has to continue.""We have to learn from the mistakes of the past, we cannot accept a weak deal which Russia can breach with ease, instead any deal must be backed by strength,"" he said.The prime minister did not state which countries had agreed to join this coalition of the willing, but said that those who had committed would intensify planning with real urgency.The UK, he said, would back its commitment with ""boots on the ground, and planes in the air"".""We are at a crossroads in history today,"" Starmer said after a summit of 18 leaders—mostly from Europe and including Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, who said Ukraine felt ""strong support"" and the summit showed ""European unity at an extremely high level not seen for a long time.""",Positive
Was Starmer's summit enough to sway  Trump? Europe stepping up is only half of the story and much depends on whether the US is willing to play its part.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn04551n6wpo,"– The European Commission chief, Ursula von der Leyen, said the purpose was to turn Ukraine into a ""steel porcupine that is indigestible for potential invaders."" The aim, it would appear, is to beef up the European offer for post-war security guarantees for Ukraine in an attempt to convince Donald Trump to promise a US military backstop. The US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said America was ready to engage with Ukraine, but the National Security Adviser Mike Waltz suggested Zelensky might have to resign as part of any ceasefire.So the outcome of the Lancaster House summit was seemingly a united European front in backing Zelensky, with the promise of more military support for Ukraine to come. But the cloud lurking in the London skies remains what the United States does next.",Positive
