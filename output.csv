"Israel strikes Lebanon after first rocket attack since ceasefire Lebanon's health ministry says seven people, including a child, were killed and 40 injured.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn4ynpzk8d8o,"– Israel has carried out multiple air strikes on Lebanon after several rockets were fired from Lebanon into Israel, in the worst violence since a ceasefire came into effect in November.The Israeli military said it had hit dozens of rocket launchers and a command center belonging to Hezbollah, the Iranian-backed militia and political group, in southern Lebanon.Lebanon's health ministry said seven people, including a child, were killed and 40 injured in the air strikes.Several armed groups operate in Lebanon, including Hezbollah and Palestinian factions, and no one has claimed responsibility for the attack. Hours after the first set of strikes, a second wave of attacks were carried out at night on targets that included what the Israeli military described as command centers, infrastructure sites, and a weapons storage facility in Lebanon. Saturday's rocket attack from Lebanon came days after Israel reinforced its offensive against Hamas, a Hezbollah ally, in Gaza.The Israeli military said it had intercepted three rockets in the northern Israeli town of Metula, and there were no casualties.Hezbollah said it had no involvement, and it remained committed to the ceasefire.The developments put pressure on a fragile truce, brokered by the US and France, that ended more than a year of conflict between Israel and Hezbollah.Under the terms of the ceasefire deal, the Lebanese military would deploy thousands of additional soldiers to the south of the country to prevent armed groups from attacking Israel.Hezbollah was required to remove its fighters and weapons, while the Israeli military would withdraw from positions occupied in the war.But Israel has carried out nearly daily air strikes on what it describes as Hezbollah targets, and has indicated that attacks will continue to prevent the group from rearming.",Negative

The man with a mind-reading chip in his brain - thanks to Elon Musk Noland Arbaugh tells the BBC how being the first Neuralink patient has changed his life.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cewk49j7j1po,"– Having a chip in your brain that can translate your thoughts into computer commands may sound like science fiction—but it is a reality for Noland Arbaugh.
