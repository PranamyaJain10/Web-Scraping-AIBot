Ukraine ready to accept 30-day ceasefire with Russia President Zelensky said it was now up to the US to convince Russia to agree to the truce.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx2x5l8nv3mo,"– US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said he would present the offer to Russia late on Tuesday that he hoped Russia would accept the proposal.Ukraine President Volodomyr Zelensky said it was now up to the US to convince Russia to agree to the ""positive"" proposal. Tuesday's talks in Jeddah were the first official meeting between the two countries since the extraordinary clash between Zelensky and US President Donald Trump in the Oval Office.In a joint statement, the US also said it would immediately restart intelligence sharing and security assistance to Ukraine, which Washington had suspended after the unprecedented meeting.Rubio told a press conference in Jeddah late on Tuesday that he hoped Russia would accept the proposal.Ukraine was ""ready to stop shooting and start talking,"" and if Russia rejected the offer ""then we'll unfortunately know what the impediment is to peace here"".""Today we made an offer that the Ukrainians have accepted, which is to enter into a ceasefire and into immediate negotiations,"" he said.""We'll take this offer now to the Russians and we hope they say yes to peace. The ball is in their court,"" he added.Trump said he would speak with President Putin, who would ""hopefully"" agree to the proposal.It takes to two tangos, as they say,"" Trump said, adding he hoped the deal would be agreed in the next few days.""We have a big meeting with Russia tomorrow, and some great conversations hopefully will ensue.""He added that he was open to inviting Zelensky to Washington.Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said Russia had not ruled out sanctions against Moscow without offering the Ukrainian president to stop attacks on the ground.""It is time for the full truth,"" Zelensky said.Three continued drone attacks on the ground on Tuesday.",Positive
"It's Russia that may now be feeling the pressure It's time for Russia's intentions towards Ukraine to be tested in public, writes the BBC's Paul Adams.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c70e992rw30o,"– US Secretary of State Marco Rubio says, ""the ball is now in Russia's court."" This is a significant moment.The joint statement from the US and Ukraine, after a long day of talks in Jeddah, contains several key lines, perhaps none more important than this: ""The United States will communicate to Russia that Russian reciprocity is the key to achieving peace.""We've heard a lot, in recent weeks, about what Donald Trump expects from Ukraine and what sort of blunt instruments the White House is used to bend Kyiv to its will.Now, it seems, it's time for Russia's intentions to be tested, in public.Donald Trump's dealings with Vladimir Putin have so far been shrouded in uncertainty, with no obvious sign of pressure to balance that being exerted on Volodymyr Zelensky. Tuesday's US-Ukrainian statement doesn't imply that Mr Trump has suddenly changed his tune towards Mr Zelensky.Theirs is a thorny relationship, born of many years of mutual mistrust.The statement also says the Ukrainian delegation ""reiterated that European partners shall be involved in the peace process"", but sheds no light on how Washington views the likely parameters of European involvement.The meeting in Saudi Arabia feels like a timely reset after the turbulence of recent days.",Neutral

"How JD Vance sees the world - and why that matters In a speech to allies and in that infamous Oval Office row, the vice-president came out punching - but what is he fighting for?",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cly82yx09zeo,"– It was a bold and perhaps unexpected way to introduce himself to the world - by angering European allies.But days later he was back in the news, at the center of a blistering row with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, whom he accused of being ungrateful.Vance's view, the Trump administration's priority should be to make life better for Americans who have been in the country for generations, and yet have little of the nation's vast wealth.Vance has repeatedly returned to this ""America First"" - or perhaps ""Americans First"" - theme in speeches, drawing a line between what he castigates as Washington's economic and foreign policy orthodoxy abroad and the struggles of the left-behind American working class at home.Vance has repeatedly returned to this ""America First"" - or perhaps ""Americans First"" - theme in speeches, drawing a line between what he castigates as Washington's economic and foreign policy orthodoxy abroad and the struggles of the left-behind American working class at home.But Vance is also someone who, after a tough upbringing in an Ohio family with Appalachian roots and sudden fame on the back of a bestselling memoir, Hillbilly Elegy, has tried out many different views.Not only is he a former ""Never Trumper"" who described the US president in 2016 as ""reprehensible"" and ""an idiot"", his book places much of the blame for the plight of the rural poor squarely on the choices made by individuals.More recently he's shifted that blame to elites—a group he's variously defined as Democrats, conventional Republicans, liberals, corporate leaders, globalists, globalists, and academics.",Negative

Trump halts plan for 50% steel and aluminium tariffs on Canada It comes after the Canadian province of Ontario said it would suspend a 25% surcharge on US-bound electricity.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cm2y811g1dgo,"– President Trump has halted a plan to double US tariffs on Canadian steel and metal imports to 50%, just hours after first threatening them.Tariffs of 25% are still going ahead and will take effect from the 12 March.The move by the president comes after the Canadian province of Ontario suspended new charges of 25% on electricity that it sends to some northern states in the US, hours after Trump threatened to sharply increase his tariffs on the country.It marked the latest skirmish in a trade war that risks economic damage to the two North American neighbors.Trump trade adviser Peter Navarro told broadcaster CNBC, confirming that Trump would not move forward with his latest tariff threats.Canada, one of America's closest trade partners, has borne the brunt of Trump's ire as he has launched trade battles in his first months in office.The White House declared the episode a win, saying in a statement that Trump had ""once again used the leverage of the American economy, which is the best and biggest in the world, to deliver a win for the American people.""Never before in my life have I had to read so much news, watch so much news to know, here's what my industry's going to look like tomorrow.""In his social media post early on Tuesday, which threatened to double levies on Canadian steel and aluminium, Trump said he was responding to Ford's moves.",Negative
Rodrigo Duterte's downfall marks dramatic end to Philippines power struggle The ex-president is on his way to the International Criminal Court following his arrest in Manila.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c6253ly20p4o,"– Just short of his 80th birthday, Rodrigo Duterte, a man who once vowed to purge his country through a bloody anti-drugs and crime campaign, found himself outmanoeuvred and in custody.The former president was met by Philippines police as he arrived in Manila on a flight from Hong Kong, where he had been rallying support for his candidates for the upcoming mid-term election among the large Filipino diaspora there.The much-talked-about warrant for his arrest from the International Criminal Court ( ICC) was, it turned out, already in the hands of the Philippines government, which moved to swiftly execute it.How had this happened? How had a man so powerful and popular, often called ""the Trump of Asia,"" been brought so low? The most serious threat hanging over him was an investigation by the ICC into his culpability for thousands of extrajudicial killings carried out during anti-drugs campaigns he ordered - after he became president in 2016, but also during his tenure as mayor of the southern city of Davao from 2011.Mr Duterte withdrew the Philippines from the jurisdiction of the ICC in 2019, but its prosecutors argued they still had a mandate to look into alleged crimes against humanity committed before that, and launched a formal investigation in 2021.The two families struck a deal.While Duterte could not run again in the 2022 election, but his daughter Sara, mayor of southern city of Davao, was also popular and a strong contender to replace him.However, Ferdinand Marcos' son Bongbong, who had been in politics all his life, was also well placed to win and very well-funded.President Marcos now appears to have moved deftly to neutralize his main political rival.",Positive
"Medieval ring found in field expected to fetch up to $23,000 The retired firefighter says he was left ""amazed"" when he spotted some gold glistening in the mud.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckgzm3857emo,"– A rare Medieval bishop's ring found by a retired firefighter in a Norfolk field is expected to fetch up to $18,000 at auction.The gold ring, which has a central hexagonal cabochon sapphire with two emeralds and two garnets, was uncovered by detectorist Mark Sell, 63, in King Row, Shipdham, in 2019.Mr Sell said he was ""amazed"" when he spotted some gold glistening in the mud and planned to split the money with the landowner.The ring, which dates from the late 12th to early 13th Century, will go under the hammer at Noonans Mayfair on 26 March.Mr Sell said he had been in the field a couple of times before, but had not found anything of importance.I was amazed to see a thin line of gold in the clod of mud that I had dug up, and as I wiped away the mud, I could see the bezel of a medieval gold jewelled ring.""This form of Medieval ring, with a principal cabochon stone - usually a sapphire - surrounded by smaller collet set satellite stones (garnets or rubies, and emeralds), can be securely dated to the late 12th or early 13th Century, and is associated with the bishopric.""",Positive
USAID staff told to shred and burn classified documents,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cjw2yywy3x7o,"– Staff at the US Agency for International Development (USAID) have been told to shred and burn classified documents and personnel files. The request raised alarm among employees and labor groups amid the ongoing dismantling of the agency.Acting Executive Secretary Erica Y Carr sent an email that thanked staff for clearing out classified safes and personnel documents from a Washington DC office and told them to meet in the building's lobby for an all-day disposal event on Tuesday. ""Shred as many documents first, and reserve the burn bags for when the shredder becomes available or needs a break,"" her email to staff read.Typically, documents placed in burn bags for disposal are sealed and then taken to a secure site for incineration.The email asked staff not to overfill the burn bags and label them with the words ""SECRET"" and ""USAID (B/IO)"" - which stands for bureau, or independent office - using permanent markers.The American Foreign Service Association (AFSA), a union representing USAID staff, was aware employees had been asked to shred documents, spokesperson Nikki Gamer told the BBC.The union said it was ""alarmed"" by the reports and warned that such documents ""may be relevant to ongoing litigation regarding the termination of USAID employees and the cessation of USAID grants.""There is no indication in this email order that any thought is being given to proper retention or even identifying which records can be destroyed and which records cannot,"" said Kel McClanahan.Mr McClanahan filed a complaint with the National Archives and Records Administration, asking them to ""take immediate measures"" to stop the destruction of records.",Negative
