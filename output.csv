But this year, the tradition has been thrown into question.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c2lk0zq7kg5o,"– One of three annual thoroughbred races—along with the Kentucky Derby and the Belmont Stakes—that make up what is known as the Triple Crown, the Preakness Stakes has long been known as one of the most glamorously bacchanal events in US sports. Held at the Pimlico Race Course in Baltimore, Maryland, it brings together the rowdy and the rich. But this year, Donald Trump has enforced swift, dramatic economic policy changes, leading to consumer pessimism unseen in over half a century.Much of the current market-rattling turmoil is a result of Trump's sweeping global tariffs, announced on 2 April. Dubbed ""Liberation Day"", he said the new economic strategy would usher in ""the golden age of America.""But at Pimlico, the state of Maryland is betting big, with plans to demolish the track right after Saturday's event and rebuild a new course in its place, plus a state-of-the-art training facility. University of Kentucky economics professor Justin Balthrop told the BBC that a rise in gambling also could be a sign of economic distress.""People who reach a certain level of despair will start to take on more risk, in an effort to literally gamble their way back to a place where they feel like they can be more comfortable,"" Professor Balthrop said.""You combine that with this idea that maybe they are so pessimistic, that this gives them the dopamine rush or endorphin release.""",Negative

Even the toilet could be used only at specific allotted times, and they were filthy—waste from the toilets above would constantly drip down on to us."" These are some of what prisoners in Chinese jails are subjected to, according to Australian citizen Matthew Radalj, who spent five years at the Beijing No 2 prison—a facility used for international inmates.Radalj, who is now living outside China, has decided to go public about his experience, and described undergoing and witnessing severe physical punishment, forced labor, food deprivation, and psychological torture.The BBC has been able to corroborate Radalj's testimony with several former prisoners who were behind bars at the same time he was.Court documents indicate that this worked at least to some extent, earning him a four-year sentence.Radalj said that prisoners were regularly subjected to forms of what he described as psychological torture.One of these was the ""good behavior points system"" which was a way—at least in theory—to reduce your sentence.Radalj said that there were also men being held from Afghanistan, Britain, the US, Latin America, North Korea and Taiwan.He claims the guards would deliberately wait till an inmate had almost reached this goal and then penalize them on any one of a huge list of possible infractions which would cancel out points at the crucial time.""There was also group pressure on prisoners with entire cell groups punished if one prisoner did any of these things.""I was in really bad shape when I arrived.They beat me for two days straight in the first police station that I was in.I hadn't slept or eaten or had water for 48 hours and then I was forced to sign a big stack of documents.""",Negative
Pop culture re-invented the Menendez brothers - but can it set them free? The brothers' fate will now be in the hands of California's Parole Board and Governor Gavin Newsom.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c79ed21xyyro,"– It was once unthinkable that Lyle and Erik Menendez, the men who murdered their wealthy parents by shooting them 16 times, would get the sympathy and forgiveness of the masses.Their claims of sexual abuse at the hands of their father were mocked by prosecutors and comedians alike, from late-night TV to jokes at the Academy Awards. But 35 years later—thanks in part to TikTok, Netflix and stars like Kim Kardashian—the Menendez brothers have a new generation of supporters—many who were not even born in 1989, the year the brothers ambushed their parents with shotguns in their Beverly Hills mansion.At the time of their trials, the brothers were portrayed as greedy, entitled monsters who went on a $700,000 spending spree in the weeks after the murders.New evidence about the alleged sexual abuse had surfaced and Netflix released a drama that captured the attention of a whole new generation.This week, a Los Angeles judge reduced the brothers' sentence to include the possibility of parole, which could be granted at a hearing next month.The brothers were described as bad boys and spoiled children who were motivated to kill their parents out of hatred and hopes to acquire their $14 million estate.In the 1990s, society did not have the same understanding we do today of trauma, sexual abuse, and harassment, Whitney Phillips, a University of Oregon professor who studies true crime, told the BBC.The new testimonies helped give new life to the brothers' claims, and provided a catalyst for what Prof Phillips called a ""hurricane of interest and support, from the Netflix drama to Kardashian's op-ed.""The things that get really big online are things that have lots of sources of energy,"" she said.Even Lyle Menendez noted the sea change.""The followers who are younger that are on that sort of TikTok social media generation, they really have tremendous hope,"" Lyle Menendez said at a court hearing.""The lock people up forever attitude of the 1990s is long gone,"" said Robert Rand, a journalist who met and interviewed the brothers before they were arrested and uncovered new evidence in 2018.",Negative
