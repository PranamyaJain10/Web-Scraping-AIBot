"Trump signs order to begin dismantling of US education department The move, which he promised to do on the campaign trail, is already facing legal challenges.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c07zpmzxln1o,"– President Trump has signed an executive order directing officials to begin dismantling the Department of Education, a promise he made on the 2024 campaign trail.The executive order is likely to face legal challenges, like many of the Trump administration's efforts to shrink the size of the federal government.At the ceremony, Trump praised Linda McMahon, whom he appointed to lead the department, and expressed his hope she would be the last secretary of education.Trump has long called for the department to be axed, a cherished goal of some conservatives, but completely shutting it would require an act of Congress, which is unlikely.The move is already facing legal challenges from those seeking to block the agency's closure as well as sweeping cuts to its staff announced last week.Trump said ""the US spends more money on education by far than any other country"" yet students ""rank near the bottom of the list in terms of success.""I hope you will join me in ensuring that when our final mission is complete; we will be able to say that we left American education freer, stronger, and with more hope for the future.""",Positive

On 11 March, the Trump administration made drastic cuts to the department using a process known as a reduction in force, halving its staff. McMahon said the downsizing showed a ""commitment to efficiency, accountability, and ensuring that resources are directed where they matter most: to students, parents, and teachers.""Although the Department of Education has little oversight over the day to day operations of most schools in the US, it plays a key role in enforcing federal education guidelines and policies.The Office for Civil Rights was one of the hardest hit divisions in that first round of firings.",Positive

Russia's next move?

Roughly 40% of its federal budget is being spent on defense and internal security.And if the Russian president is victorious in Ukraine, might he then turn his attention towards them - particularly if he senses that Trump might not feel moved to intervene on their behalf?""We are around 30,000 feet above the Baltic Sea, on a Nato surveillance plane equipped with a giant, shiny, mushroom-resembling radar, enabling crew members to scan the region for hundreds of miles around, looking for suspicious Russian activity.Air policing missions like this - and NATO membership more broadly - have long made tiny Baltic nations of Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia (which neighbor Russia) feel safe.But US President Donald Trump is changing that, thanks to his affinity with Vladimir Putin, which has been evident since his first term in office.Trump has been very clear with Europe that, for the first time since World War II, the continent can no longer take US military support for granted.The border police have recorded thermal imaging of buoys in the Narva River that demarcate the border between the two countries being removed by Russian guards under the cover of darkness.Estonia, alongside Lithuania and Poland, jointly announced this week that they're asking their respective parliaments to approve a withdrawal from the international anti-personnel mines' treaty which prohibits the use of those mines, signed by 160 countries worldwide.This was to allow them ""greater flexibility"" in defending their borders, they said.",Positive

"Why Elon Musk's Grok is kicking up a storm in India The chatbot has become an ""unfiltered and unhinged"" digital sensation in India.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cd65p1pv8pdo,"– It all started with one question.A query last week from an X (formerly Twitter) account called Toka was enough to propel Elon Musk's built-in-chatbot called Grok 3 into a viral storm across India's digital landscape.And no, it wasn't some complex math equation or a philosophical debate.Instead, it was a simple ask: ""List my 10 best mutuals on X."" Mutuals are people who follow and engage with each other's posts.When Grok took a moment to respond, Toka, clearly frustrated, let loose some colorful language.The chatbot shot back. It dropped a list of 10 mutuals but threw in some misogynistic insults in Hindi too. Grok shrugged it off, saying, ""I was just having fun, but lost control."" The response grabbed two million views and other X users quickly followed suit, provoking the chatbot. Grok has just recently become an ""unfiltered and unhinged"" digital sensation in India, as many are calling it.Just last year, Musk dubbed it the ""most fun AI in the world!""",Positive
