Trump raises Canada tariff to 35% as US announces new levies for dozens of countries Sweeping new tariff rates were announced just hours before a deadline the administration had set for countries to strike trade deals.,https://www.bbc.com/news/live/cpqvdxzwv22t,"– Canada's tariff rate from 25% to 35%, which came into effect at midnight US East Coast time (04:00 GMT) Hours before a deadline to strike trade deals, the White House released new levies for dozens of other countries which will come into effect on 7 August Earlier, he paused putting higher tariffs on Mexico for another 90 days Trump first announced his tariff plan in April, sending chaos rippling through the world economy. But an official, speaking on condition of anonymity, told the BBC that it was necessary to hold off until 7 August, to give US Customs and Border Protection officers ""sufficient time to fully implement these tariffs."" The White House statement notes that goods captured by the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) are exempt from the 35% rate. The 10% tariff imposed on Brazil is separate to the 40% tariff from yesterday, the official said, meaning, ""Brazil stacks to 50% on most goods."" Trump has framed these tariffs as retaliation over the prosecution of his ally, right-wing former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro.",Positive
"Trump's global tariffs 'victory' may well come at a high price The US President considers it a win - but if this all triggers a foundational realignment, the results may not break in his favour",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0l6g13rlwko,"– In April Donald Trump stunned the world by announcing sweeping new import tariffs—only to put most on hold amid the resulting global financial panic.Four months later, the US president is touting what he claims are a series of victories, having unveiled a handful of deals with trading partners and unilaterally imposed tariffs on others, all without the kind of massive disruptions to the financial markets that his spring attempt triggered.At least, so far.Having worked to reorder America's place in the global economy, Trump is now promising that the US will reap the benefits of new revenue, rekindle domestic manufacturing, and generate hundreds of billions of dollars in foreign investment and purchases.Whether that turns out to be the case—and whether these actions will have negative consequences—is still very much in doubt.What is clear so far, however, is that a tide that was (gently) turning on free trade, even ahead of Trump's second term, has become a wave crashing across the globe.Trump may have hailed the size of the agreement of the US with the EU—but these are not the tariff-busting deals we equated with tearing down trade barriers in previous decades.The greatest fears, the warnings of potential disaster, have not been realized.Second, the agreement of tariff terms, however unpalatable, reduced much of the uncertainty (itself wielded by Trump as a powerful economic weapon) for better - and for worse.What is clear so far, however, is that a tide that was (gently) turning on free trade, even ahead of Trump's second term, has become a wave crashing across the globe.",Positive

'Like a sci-fi movie': US baby born from 30-year-old frozen embryo breaks record It is believed to be longest that an embryo has been frozen before resulting in a successful live birth.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3wne86ex9qo,"– A baby boy has been born to an Ohio couple from an embryo that was frozen for more than 30 years, reportedly setting a new world record.Lindsey, 35, and Tim Pierce, 34, welcomed their son, Thaddeus Daniel Pierce, on Saturday.Ms Pierce told MIT Technology Review her family thought ""it's like something from a sci-fi movie.""It is believed to be longest that an embryo has been frozen before resulting in a successful live birth.The previous record-holder was a pair of twins who were born in 2022 from embryos frozen in 1992.The Pierces had tried to have a child for seven years before they decided to adopt the embryo Linda Archerd, 62, made with her then-husband in 1994 through IVF.Ms Archerd initially created four embryos.

"Tech giants blocking some Ukraine and Gaza posts under new online rules Tech companies are restricting debates of public interest to comply the Online Safety Act, analysis shows.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cj3l0e4vr0ko,"– Social media companies are blocking wide-ranging content—including posts about the wars in Ukraine and Gaza—in an attempt to comply with the UK's new Online Safety Act, BBC Verify has found.The new legislation, which came into effect last Friday, imposes fines on social media companies and other websites which fail to protect under-18s from pornography, posts promoting self-harm, and other harmful content.Under the act harmful content includes posts containing pornography, or any which encourage self-harm, eating disorders, or promote violence.The examples gathered by BBC Verify are largely focused on X and Reddit, as they clearly flag age-restricted content.When users who had not verified their age attempted to access the post they were met with a message reading: ""Due to local laws, we are temporarily restricting access to this content until X estimates your age.""",Positive

Young Ukrainians get their way as Zelensky overturns law to defuse crisis Ukraine's parliament votes to restore the independence of two anti-corruption agencies after large-scale protests.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cpv0n0ky4xro,"– Ukraine's MPs gathered at parliament in Kyiv on Thursday, some held cardboard signs that read, ""We are with our people.""It was a message to thousands of young protesters who had taken part in the biggest anti-government demonstrations since the start of Russia's full-scale invasion.The MPs then entered parliament, the Rada, and took part in a vote that overwhelmingly overturned a law introduced by President Volodymyr Zelensky last week that curtailed the independence of two key anti-corruption agencies known as Nabu and Sap - the National Anti-Corruption Bureau and Specialised Anti-Corruption Prosecutor's Office.The signs carried by the MPs outside the Rada were a nod to the placards carried by thousands of young people who had taken to the streets in towns and cities across Ukraine for almost a week.The protesters had demanded that Zelensky and his government ""take their hands off"" the two anti-corruption bodies, and they threatened to continue carry on until the government made a U-turn.Within days, it did. Zelensky's original bill had stripped the two bodies of their independent authority to decide who to prosecute in high-level corruption cases, giving that prerogative to the general prosecutor - a presidential appointee.The MPs did their best to show the problem was now solved, but this crisis has left behind an unpleasant aftertaste.It has brought into question Zelensky's dedication to the anti-corruption reforms.Zelensky's move also came after the government rejected a candidate selected by an independent commission to head the Bureau for Economic Security - the main agency for investigating economic crimes in Ukraine.The official reason Oleksandr Tsyvinski didn't get the job was that he didn't get the security clearance from the security service, and that is under the president's control.However, Tsyvinski is a well-regarded anti-corruption expert and the selection commission still wants him appointed.The protesters had demanded that Zelensky and his bill be reversed.",Negative

""I could take this one, drop it right down there, and it would be beautiful.""
