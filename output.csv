"Adorable or just weird? How Labubu dolls conquered the world The dolls have almost tripled their maker's profits - and, according to some, energised Chinese soft power.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy4ydxlm9n9o,"– It's a question that still bothers many—and even those who know the answer are not entirely sure they can explain the craze.Labubu is both a fictional character and a brand.The vinyl faces are attached to plush bodies, and come with a signature look— pointy ears, big eyes and a mischievous grin showing exactly nine teeth.You get such a sense of achievement when you are able to get it among such fierce competition.""My husband doesn't understand why me, someone in their 30s, would be so fixated on something like this, like caring about which color to get,"" says avowed fan Fiona Zhang.The Labubu brand also has other characters from its universe, which have inspired their own popular dolls—such as the tribe's leader Zimomo, her boyfriend Tycoco and her friend Mokoko.Labubu's fame has certainly rubbed off, with other specimens in the family also flying off the shelves.Pop Mart had been selling so-called blind boxes—where customers only found out what they had bought when they opened the package—for some years when they tied up with Kasing for the rights to Labubu.The demand did not rise overnight though.It actually took a few years for the elfin monsters to break into the mainstream.",Positive
"Plastic bag bans and fees curb US shoreline litter, study suggests Shoreline litter data research shows policies caused a relative decrease in the percentage of plastic bags.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cdeznkxyek0o,"– A study of the country's litter suggests.Data from thousands of cleanups showed that areas which tried to reduce bag use saw them fall by at least 25% as a percentage of total litter collected, compared to areas that didn't try.Bans or charging for bags worked better at state rather than town level, and had a bigger impact in places that had a bigger litter problem to begin with.Despite the good news, the researchers cautioned that, overall, more plastic bags are being found across the US—they're just increasing less in those places trying to tackle the issue.Plastic bag laws in the US vary considerably by state, county and town, which made it a useful place to test the effectiveness of bag policies.Policies range from bans and partial bans (where only thinner bags are banned), to charges on bags and pre-emption laws, where states prevent counties and towns from regulating plastic bags themselves.The researchers used data from shoreline cleanups that recorded bags as a percentage of all items collected, and looked at how this differed in areas with a policy compared to those without.On average, bags made up 4.5% of items collected in cleanups, and were the fifth most common item found after cigarette butts, food wrappers, plastic bottle caps and plastic drinks bottles.Different models were used to analyse the data, which estimated that the relative decrease in bags in areas with a policy was between 25% and 47%.Despite the good news, the researchers cautioned that, overall, more plastic bags are being found across the US—they're just increasing less in those places trying to tackle the issue.One key policy opportunity would be the first global plastics treaty that 175 countries will continue negotiating in August, after talks collapsed in December.",Positive
"At least 12 Palestinians killed waiting for aid in Gaza, say medics",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0ep17gyzrzo,"– At least 12 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli forces while waiting for aid in central Gaza, according to rescuers and medics.Reports say the group was killed by gunfire near an aid distribution site run by the US- and Israeli-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) on Thursday.The GHF denied there were any incidents near its site.The Israeli military told Reuters that ""suspects"" had attempted to approach forces in the area of Netzarim, and that soldiers had fired warning shots.It said it was unaware of any injuries.The incident is the latest in almost daily shootings near such aid sites in Gaza.Hundreds of Palestinians have been killed since late May, when the GHF took over aid distribution in Gaza in an attempt by Israel to bypass the UN as the main supplier of aid.Nearly all the casualties in Gaza in recent days have been linked to incidents around the delivery of aid, rather than Israeli strikes on Hamas targets.Gaza's health ministry said on Thursday that since midnight 12 people had been killed while seeking aid, without giving further details.The Hamas-run civil defense agency - Gaza's main emergency service - told AFP news agency that a group was killed by Israeli gunfire near the Netzarim corridor, where thousands of people have been gathering daily seeking aid.Civil defense official Mohammad al-Mughayyir said 15 people were killed and 60 injured in the incident.Israel does not allow international news organizations, including the BBC, into Gaza, making it difficult to verify figures.",Negative
