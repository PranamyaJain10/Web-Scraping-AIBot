"'This is so hard': The Chinese small businesses brought to a standstill by Trump's tariffs Stock is piling up in warehouses as exporters grapple with new levies that total up to 145%, reports the BBC's China correspondent Laura Bicker.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c05ne2vmd3po,"– ""Trump is a crazy man,"" says Lionel Xu, who is surrounded by his company's mosquito repellent kits—many were once best sellers in Walmart stores in the United States.Now those products are sitting in boxes in a warehouse in China and will remain there unless President Trump lifts his 145% tariffs on all Chinese goods bound for the US.""This is so hard for us,"" he adds.The world's two largest economies have hit an impasse and Chinese goods meant for US households are piling up on factory floors.The effects of this trade war will likely be felt in kitchens and living rooms across America, who will now have to buy these goods at higher prices.China has maintained its defiant stance and has vowed to fight this trade war ""until the end.""It is a tone also used by some at the fair.China does have a large population of 1.4 billion people and in theory this is a strong domestic market.Chinese policymakers have also been trying to stimulate more growth in a sluggish economy by encouraging consumers to spend.But it is not working.Last year, exports accounted for around half of the country's economic growth.China also remains the world's factory—with Goldman Sachs estimating that around 10 to 20 million people in China may be working on US-bound exports alone.",Negative
"The perils of Trump's chips strategy: the US will struggle to take on Asia America is trying to create a chip industry through isolation and protectionism, when what allowed it to emerge in Asia is the opposite: collaboration",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cd9ljwgg9y0o,"– The US has ""dropped the ball"" on chip manufacturing over the years, allowing China and other Asian hubs to steam ahead.Four years on, chips remain a battleground in the US-China race for tech supremacy, and US President Donald Trump now wants to turbocharge a highly complex and delicate manufacturing process that has taken other regions decades to perfect.He says his tariff policy will liberate the US economy and bring jobs home, but it is also the case that some of the biggest companies have long struggled with a lack of skilled workers and poor-quality produce in their American factories.So what will Trump do differently? And, given that Taiwan and other parts of Asia have the secret sauce on creating high-precision chips, is it even possible for the US to produce them too, and at scale? Semiconductors are central to powering everything from washing machines to iPhones, and military jets to electric vehicles.The significant subsidies that China, Taiwan, Japan and South Korea have given to private companies developing chips are a big reason for their success.This isn't just a factory where you make boxes.The factories that make chips are such high-tech sterile environments, they take years and years to build.""And despite the US investment, TSMC has said that most of its manufacturing will remain in Taiwan, especially its most advanced computer chips. Trump has praised the chip industry but also threatened it with tariffs. He has told industry leader, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC), it would have to pay a tax of 100% if it did not build factories in the US.",Positive
"Watch: Rare footage from Sudanese city under siege obtained by BBC El-Fasher residents Mostafa, Hafiza and Manahel film as their home city comes under fire in Sudan's civil war.",https://www.bbc.com/news/videos/c0r57e55zz0o,"– The Sudanese city of el-Fasher has been largely cut off from the outside world for a year as a result of the country's civil war, which began two years ago. The BBC managed to send phones to three residents of the city—Mostafa, Hafiza and Manahel—who wanted to film their lives. In many of the videos they sent, the sound of shelling and gunfire can be heard in the background. Their footage was recorded between August and November, by which time they all decided it was too dangerous to stay in el-Fasher and left the city. Desperate residents have been fleeing floodwaters by wading or paddling to safety in homemade canoes.",Negative

His memories uncovered a secret jail - right next to an international airport The BBC shares accounts from six men forced into detention under the now-deposed government of former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cly6lp567r8o,"– When investigators smashed through a hastily built wall, they uncovered a set of secret jail cells.It turned out to be a freshly bricked-up doorway—an attempt to hide what lurked behind.Inside, off a narrow hallway, were tiny rooms to the right and left. It was pitch-black.The team may never have found this clandestine jail—a stone's throw from Dhaka's International Airport—without the recollections of Mir Ahmad Bin Quasem and others.A critic of Bangladesh's ousted leader, he was held there for eight years.He was blindfolded for much of his time in the prison, so he leaned on the sounds he could recall—and he distinctly remembered the sound of planes landing.Hasina's party says the alleged crimes were carried out without its knowledge, that it bears no responsibility and that the military establishment operated alone—a charge the army rejects. Seven months on, Quasem and others may have been released, but they remain terrified of their captors, who are serving security force members and are all still free.Quasem believes it is important for the world to see what was done.""The high officials, the top brass who aided and abetted, facilitated the fascist regime are still in their position,"" he says.Previous reports said he was kept inside a notorious detention facility—known as Aynaghor, or ""House of Mirrors""—inside the main intelligence headquarters in Dhaka, but investigators now believe there were many such sites.Quasem says he spent all his detention at the RAB base, apart from the first 16 days. Investigators now suspect the first site was a detective branch of police in Dhaka.",Negative

Nvidia announced on Tuesday that the US government had told it last week that the H20 chip required a permit to be sold to China, including Hong Kong.The company declined to comment further when contacted by the BBC.Marc Einstein from the Counterpoint Research consultancy said the $5.5bn hit estimated by Nvidia was in line with his estimates.""While this is certainly a lot of money, this is something Nvidia can bear,"" he said.""But as we have seen in the last few days and weeks, this may largely be a negotiating tactic.Chips remain a battleground in the US-China race for tech supremacy, and US President Donald Trump now wants to turbocharge a highly complex and delicate manufacturing process that has taken other regions decades to perfect.Nvidia's AI have been a key focus export controls.",Positive
