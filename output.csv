Trouble in Arctic town as polar bears and people face warming world Climate change makes it trickier for residents to co-exist with the increasingly hungry predators.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5yg344zz1ro,"– The polar bear population here faces long-term decline.But, in the short term, the bears are spending more of their year on shore, increasing the probability of bears and people coming into contact.The decline is tied to the amount of time the bay is now ice-free, a period that is getting longer as the climate warms.The bear casually slumps back down onto all fours, then looks up and gazes at me briefly.It is deeply confusing to look into the face of an animal that is simultaneously adorable and potentially deadly.""You could see him sniffing and even licking the vehicle - using all his senses to investigate,"" says PBI's Geoff York, who has worked in the Arctic for more than three decades.The experimental rig—a tall antenna with detectors scanning 360 degrees—is installed on the roof of a lodge in the middle of the tundra, near Churchill.""It has artificial intelligence, so here we can basically teach it what a polar bear is,"" Geoff explains. polar bear attacks are rare, but they are a risk for people who live and work in isolated Arctic environments.",Negative

US makes third interest rate cut despite inflation risk Stocks dropped as the Federal Reserve warned it would be cautious about further cuts.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clyj3ym3e55o,"– The US central bank has cut interest rates for a third time, despite concerns that the move will deliver a boost to the economy that risks reigniting inflation. The decision was expected, setting the Federal Reserve's key lending rate in a target range of 4.25% to 4.5%.That is down a full percentage point since September, when the bank started lowering borrowing costs, citing progress stabilising prices and a desire to head off economic weakening.Mr Powell defended the cut on Wednesday, pointing to cooling in the job market over the last two years.Mr Powell acknowledged that the move was a ""closer call"" on this occasion and acknowledged there is some uncertainty as the White House changes hands.The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed down by more than 2.5%, the S&P 500 fell nearly 3% and the Nasdaq tumbled by more than 3.5%.Olu Sonola, head of US economic research at Fitch Ratings, said it felt like the Fed was signalling a ""pause"" to cuts as questions about White House policies make it more unsure about the path ahead.Mr Ryding said he thought it would have been wiser for the Fed to hold off on a cut at this meeting, despite the likelihood it would upset markets.Mr Powell said he thought the Bank of England—which unlike the Fed, does not have to consider unemployment as part of its mandate—was more clearly responding to the reality of the situation in front of it.Analysts have also warned that policies backed by president-elect Donald Trump, including plans for tax cuts and widespread import tariffs, could put upward pressure on prices.Mr Ryding said he thought the Bank of England—which unlike the Fed, does not have to consider unemployment as part of its mandate—was more clearly responding to the reality of the situation in front of it.Mr Powell defended the cut on Wednesday, pointing to cooling in the job market over the last two years.Mr Powell said that the Fed's rate cuts were a ""closer call"" on Wednesday, pointing to cooling in the market over the last two years.",Negative

US Supreme Court to hear TikTok challenge to potential ban,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn4xw9lx02xo,"– The US government is taking action against the app because of what it says are its links to the Chinese state— links which TikTok and its parent company ByteDance have denied.The Supreme Court justices did not act on a request by TikTok for an emergency injunction against the law, but will instead allow TikTok and ByteDance to make their case on 10 January—nine days before the ban is due to take effect.Earlier in December, a federal appeals court rejected an attempt to overturn the legislation, saying it was ""the culmination of extensive, bipartisan action by the Congress and by successive presidents.""The Supreme Court is the highest legal authority in the US, and the decision to take on TikTok's case is significant as it only hears 100 or so cases a year out of the more than 7,000 petitions it receives.TikTok had previously argued that the attempt to ban it was unconstitutional because it would impact the free speech of its users in the country.The case has already gone through the executive branch, the legislative branch, and the lower court, all of which upheld the argument that TikTok's ownership by China-based ByteDance poses a national security risk,"" Dr Kreps said.The appeal sets up a clash between free speech and national security, according to University of Richmond law professor Carl Tobias.""The appeals court found that national security was stronger than the First Amendment contentions.While it is difficult to predict the outcome, Cornell professor Sarah Kreps said it would be surprising to the court to overturn the prior rulings and go against the wills of both congress and the White House.""I have a warm spot in my heart for TikTok, because I won youth by 34 points,"" he claimed at a press conference on Monday—though a majority of 18 to 29-year-olds backed his opponent Kamala Harris,"" he said.",Positive
