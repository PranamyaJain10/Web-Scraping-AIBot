"Trump picking Gaetz to head justice sends shockwaves - and a strong message Picking the outspoken congressman for attorney general is Trump laying down a challenge, writes Anthony Zurcher.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c2k0472q8v0o,"– Donald Trump's nomination of congressman Matt Gaetz to be his attorney general has arrived like a thunderclap in Washington.Of all the president-elect's picks for his administration so far, this is easily the most controversial—and sends a clear message that Trump intends to shake up the establishment when he returns to power.The shockwaves were still being felt on Thursday morning as focus shifted to a looming fight in the Senate over his nomination.Trump is assembling his team before he begins his term on 20 January, and his choice of defense secretary, Fox News host Pete Hegseth, and intelligence chief, former Democratic congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard, have also raised eyebrows.But it is Gaetz making most headlines.The Florida firebrand is perhaps best known for spearheading the effort to unseat then-Republican Speaker of the House Kevin McCarthy last year.But he has a history of being a flamethrower in the staid halls of Congress.In 2018, he brought a right-wing Holocaust denier to the State of the Union, and later tried to expel two fathers who lost children in a mass shooting from a hearing after they objected to a claim he made about gun control.His bombastic approach means he has no shortage of enemies, including within his own party. House Speaker Mike Johnson, another devoted Trump loyalist, called Gaetz an ""accomplished attorney.""The department also investigated Gaetz himself.Last year, it declined to bring charges over allegations he violated sex-trafficking laws during a trip he took to the Bahamas with paid escorts.All this makes him an unlikely choice for a position that typically goes to more senior politicians, well versed in law.Gaetz, 42, has a law degree and worked for a Florida law firm before his eight years in Congress. Trump in his first term picked US Senator Jeff Sessions, and later Bill Barr, who had decades of experience in Republican presidential administrations.",Positive
"Eva Longoria says her family no longer lives in 'dystopian' US The Desperate Housewives star acknowledged most Americans were not as ""privileged"" to ""get to escape"".",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cj6kw81n77go,"– Hollywood actress Eva Longoria has revealed that her family no longer lives in the United States, and is splitting time between Mexico and Spain.In an interview with French magazine Marie Claire for its November cover story, Longoria attributed the decision to the country's ""changing vibe"" after the Covid-19 pandemic, homelessness and high taxation in California, and the re-election of Donald Trump.She also acknowledged she was ""privileged"" enough to move, saying: ""Most Americans aren't so lucky. They're going to be stuck in this dystopian country.""The Desperate Housewives star is viewed as a power broker for women and Latinos in Democratic Party politics.With a keen interest in immigration policy, she has been visibly involved with Democratic candidates at the national and local level since at least 2012.She spoke at the Democratic National Convention and hit the campaign trail on behalf of Kamala Harris this year, with a tagline for the 2024 presidential candidate that adopted the Spanish translation of Barack Obama's famed ""Yes, we can"" slogan (""Si se puede"") into the phrase ""She se puede.""In her Marie Claire interview, published on Thursday, Longoria described being dispirited at Trump's victory over Harris last week.“If he keeps his promises, it's going to be a scary place,"" she said. She added that Trump's win in 2016 had crushed her belief that ""the best person wins"" in politics.“I had my whole adult life here,” Longoria said of Los Angeles, adding that “it just feels like this chapter in my life is done now.”",Positive

He has vowed to continue broadcasting using a different platform. In a rambling video message posted on Thursday morning, Jones called the takeover a ""total attack on free speech.""By divesting Jones of Infowars' assets, the families and the team at The Onion have done a public service and will meaningfully hinder Jones' ability to do more harm,"" lawyer Chris Mattei said in a statement.The Onion plans to rebuild the website and feature well-known internet humor writers and content creators.“We are planning on making it a very funny, very stupid website,” said Ben Collins, a former NBC News journalist who is chief executive of The Onion's parent company, in a statement.",Positive
