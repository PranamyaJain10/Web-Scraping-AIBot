"Murdered on the school run: The controversial Ukrainian gunned down in Madrid The killing in a Madrid suburb has shocked Ukrainians, but has not triggered an outpouring of grief.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cpd41g661epo,"– Andriy Portnov's murder in a Madrid suburb has shocked Ukrainians, but it has not exactly triggered an outpouring of grief.The controversial former official had just dropped his children off at the American School when he was shot several times in the car park.Ukraine's media have been discussing the 51-year-old's frequent threats to journalists, as well as his huge influence under the country's last pro-Russian president, Viktor Yanukovych.""A man who called for the killing of political opponents suddenly got what he wanted from others,"" observed reporter Oleksandr Holubov. Portnov was controversial and widely disliked.The irony of Portnov eventually settling in Spain and sending his children to a prestigious American school has not been lost on many.Some Spanish media reports suggest his murder was not political, but rather over ""economic reasons or revenge"".""It could have been the Russians because he knew so many things,"" suggests legal expert Mykhailo Zhernakov.""He was involved in so many shady Russian operations it could be them or other criminal groups.He managed to annoy a lot of people,"" he says. Portnov later pursued activists who took part in Ukraine's Maidan Revolution, which toppled Viktor Yanukovych from power, and forced him to escape the country to Russia.""He used sexual threats,"" says Oksana Romaniuk who remembers her and other journalists' interactions with Portnov well.Mykhailo Zhernakov, a legal expert and head of the Dejure Foundation believes Portnov remoulded it in order for the government to cover up illegal schemes, and to mask Russian attempts to control the country.""He was the kingpin, mastermind and architect of this corrupt legal system designed to serve the pro-Russian administration at the time,"" he says.",Negative

Graeme Groom, a British surgeon working in the hospital who operated on her surviving 11-year-old boy, told the BBC it was ""unbearably cruel"" that his mother, who spent years caring for children as a paediatrician, could lose almost all her own in a single missile strike.Israel's military said its aircraft had struck ""a number of suspects"" in Khan Younis on Friday, and ""the claim regarding harm to uninvolved civilians is under review.""Since both his parents are doctors, he seemed to be among the privileged group within Gaza, but as we lifted him onto the operating table, he felt much younger than 11,"" he added.Mr Groom said the surviving 11-year-old boy, Adam, was ""quite small"" for his age.The hospital initially posted on Facebook that eight children had been killed, then two hours later updated that number to nine.Mr Groom said the surviving 11-year-old boy, Adam, was ""quite small"" for his age.Mr Groom said the al-Najjars' family house was hit minutes after Dr al-Najjar's husband Hamdi had returned home after driving his wife to work.Dr Alboursh said the eldest of Dr al-Najjar's children was aged 12.Mr Groom said the children's father was ""very badly injured"" in a video posted on the Instagram account of another British surgeon working at Nasser hospital, Victoria Rose.He told the BBC that he had asked about the father, also a doctor at the hospital, and had been told he had ""no political and no military connections and doesn't seem to be prominent on social media.""Our little boy could survive, but we don't know about his father,"" he added.",Negative

"King's invite to Canada sends a message to Trump - and the world Canada once downplayed the monarchy. Now, it is leaning on it to assert its sovereignty.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c04erp9gxkyo,"– Canada has, throughout its 157-year-old history, sought increasing independence from the British monarchy, while still remaining a part of the Commonwealth.When Liberal Prime Minister Justin Trudeau succeeded Harper four years later, the Queen's portrait went down, the Quebec paintings, back up.It comes at a consequential time for Canada, after the US president spent months undermining Canada's sovereignty by saying it would be better off as a US state.Carney heavily campaigned on standing up to Trump, after the US president spent months undermining Canada's sovereignty by saying it would be better off as a US state.It is also a way for Prime Minister Carney to improve the relationship with Trump, who is famously a fan of the British monarchy and its history.""Strengthening the relationship with the monarchy puts a stamp on that individual parties and the current political climate,"" Mr Vovk said.It also works to tie Canada closer to Europe - a key objective of Prime Minister Carney, a former governor of the Bank of England, who has spoken about the need for Canada to find new allies as it navigates its changing relationship with the US.The visit is ""a huge affirmation and statement about the uniqueness of Canada and its traditions,"" Justin Vovk, a Canadian royal historian, told the BBC—""a theatrical display that is meant to show what makes Canadians separate from Americans"" and not, as Trump has often repeated, a ""51st state.""",Positive
Victims in landmark child abuse trial ask why France doesn't want to know The trial of France's most prolific known paedophile comes to an end this week amid widespread frustration.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvg559zz3d8o,"– The trial of France's most prolific known paedophile, Joel Le Scouarnec—a retired surgeon who has admitted in court to raping or sexually assaulting 299 people, almost all of them children—is coming to an end this Wednesday amid widespread frustration.""I'm exhausted. I'm angry. Right now, I don't have much hope. Society seems totally indifferent. It's frightening to think [the rapes] could happen again,"" one of Le Scouarnec's victims, Manon Lemoine, 36, told the BBC.The court in Vannes has heard in excruciating detail how Le Scouarnec, 74, wallowed in his paedophilia, carefully detailing each child rape in a succession of black notebooks, often preying on his vulnerable young patients while they were under anesthesia or recovering from surgery.The group has questioned why a parliamentary commission has not been set up, as in other high-profile abuse cases, and spoken of being made to feel ""invisible"", as if ""the sheer number of victims prevented us from being recognized.""The Le Scouarnec case is not mobilising a lot of people.Perhaps because of the number of victims.The court has also been told of the retired surgeon's growing isolation, and of what his own lawyer described as ""your descent into hell"", in the final decade before he was caught, in 2017, after abusing a neighbor's six-year-old daughter.",Negative

""But in the past year-and-a-half our congregation has tripled in size."" During the Sunday liturgy at Father Moses's church, I am struck by the number of men in their thirties and praying and crossing themselves at the back of the nave, and how this religion—with traditions dating back to the 4th century AD—seems to attract young men uneasy with life in modern America.ROCOR, a global network with headquarters in New York, has recently been expanding across parts of the US—mainly as a result of people converting from other faiths.",Positive

'It's not fair': Other refugees in limbo as US welcomes white South Africans,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/czellw10ejdo,"– A man slept outside in a car park overnight in Kenya with his wife and infant son in January, consumed by confusion and disbelief.The family, refugees from the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), had been expecting a flight to the US for resettlement in just hours' time.But after US President Donald Trump suspended the US refugee program just two days before the family's scheduled departure, the man was told their flight to America was abruptly cancelled—less than 24 hours before take-off.""I didn't have anywhere else to go,"" the man, who asked to go by the name of Pacito to protect his identity, told the BBC.Trump's move signaled a major change in the approach that was followed by successive US leaders.Under former President Joe Biden, over 100,000 refugees came to the US in 2024 - the highest annual figure in nearly three decades.The effort has also included an ambitious deportation program under which people have been deported to a notorious mega-prison in El Salvador against a judge's orders, as well as revoking visas from over a thousand university students, and offering illegal immigrants a sum of $1,000 each to ""self-deport.""The situation has left Pacito feeling stuck.Since he has sold all of the equipment that he needed to work in his field of music production, for the past few months he has struggled to find odd jobs to earn money for his family.The moves appear in stark contrast to the White House's decision to fast-track the arrival of white South Africa's white population.Trump signed an executive order in February that opened the refugee pathway exclusively to Afrikaners—white South Africans who he claimed were victims of ""racial discrimination.""It's not fair,"" Pacito commented.",Negative
