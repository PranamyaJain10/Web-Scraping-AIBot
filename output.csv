"Zelensky says war will 'end sooner' with Trump as president The Ukrainian president also said his country ""must do everything"" to ensure the war ends next year.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0mzgv4x901o,"– Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky says he is certain the war with Russia will end sooner than it otherwise would have once Donald Trump becomes US president.Zelensky said he had a ""constructive exchange"" with Trump during their phone conversation after his victory in the US presidential election.He did not say whether Trump had made any demands regarding possible talks with Russia, but said he'd not heard anything from him that was contrary to Ukraine's position.Trump has consistently said his priority is to end the war—which began with Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022—and what he describes as a drain on US resources in the form of military aid to Kyiv.The US has been the greatest supplier of arms to Ukraine. Zelensky said in an interview with the Ukrainian media outlet Suspilne.He added that Ukraine ""must do everything so that this war ends next year, ends through diplomatic means"", with Russian forces making advances on the battlefield.The front lines of the war have largely stagnated since Ukraine's much-anticipated counter-offensive in 2023 failed to make the sweeping territorial gains it had aimed to.Russian forces occupy entrenched positions in the east and south-east of the country, with fighting predominantly taking place in the eastern Donbas region.Zelensky has said the operation's goal was to divert Russian troops away from the front lines in Ukraine, though it is unclear whether it has achieved this.Germany Chancellor Olaf Scholz, who spoke with Trump following the US election win, told German media that the incoming US leader had a ""more nuanced"" position on the war than was commonly assumed.",Negative
'Anointed by God': The Christians who see Trump as their saviour Many churchgoers consider Trump their hope as more Americans turn away from religion.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c20g1zvgj4do,"– ""The bullet that went through his ear missed his brain by a millimetre, and his head turned just at the last second when the gun was fired,"" he says. ""I believe that God turned his head and saved his life."" Yet even before the attempt on his life on 13 July in Butler, Pennsylvania, millions of Americans already felt guided by their faith to support the former, and now future, president. Some cast the election in an apocalyptic light and likened Trump to a Biblical figure.Last year, on the Christian show FlashPoint, TV evangelist Hank Kunneman described ""a battle between good and evil,"" adding: ""There's something on President Trump that the enemy fears: it's called the anointing."" Jim Caviezel, an actor who played Jesus in Mel Gibson's The Passion of the Christ, proclaimed, albeit jokingly, that Trump was ""the new Moses."" Some of the reason some Christians may find it easier to look past questions of character is that during Trump's first term in office he delivered on a particular promise: to appoint anti-abortion judges to the US Supreme Court.Mr Graham points to this as evidence that the president-elect is a man of integrity.The selection of Mike Huckabee as ambassador to Israel is already a hint that faith might shape some foreign policy.",Positive
‘Do not pet’: Why are robot dogs patrolling Mar-A-Lago? Robotic dogs are helping law enforcement protect President-elect Donald Trump at his Florida residence.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c30p16gn3pvo,"– A robotic dog named Spot made by Boston Dynamics is the latest tool in the arsenal of the US Secret Service.The device has lately been spotted patrolling the perimeter of President-elect Donald Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort in Palm Beach, Florida.They do not have weapons—and each can be controlled remotely or automatically—as long as its route is pre-programmed.Passers-by are warned by a sign on each of Spot's legs: ""DO NOT PET.""Ron Williams, a former Secret Service agent who is now CEO of the security and risk management firm Talon Companies, suspects the assassination attempts against Trump added urgency to the agency's push ""to upgrade the technology that can enhance the ability to detect and deter.""Spot is known for its agility.It can walk up and down stairs and navigate tight spaces.But its ability to reveal potential threats ranks high among the reasons that so many agencies appear willing to pay up to $75,000 (£59,000) for the device.Secret Service communications chief Guglielmi said the robotic dogs were ""equipped with surveillance technology, and an array of advanced sensors that support our protective operations.""I don't know that anyone is tempted to pet these robot dogs. They do not look cuddly,"" said Melissa Michelson, a political scientist at Menlo College.Boston Dynamics also declined to answer specific questions, although it confirmed the Secret Service was deploying its Spot robot.",Positive

"Senators call for probe into Musk's alleged contact with Russia Musk’s reported relations with Russia “pose serious questions” about US national security, the Democratic senators argue.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy0l3wl76gzo,"– Two top Senate Democrats have called for an investigation into Elon Musk's reported contacts with Russian President Vladimir Putin and his top aides.The lawmakers have urged the Pentagon and Justice Department to determine whether Musk's alleged relations with a US adversary while holding major government contracts puts national security at risk.The Wall Street Journal reported last month that the world's richest person has had ""multiple, high level conversations"" with Putin since 2022, which the Kremlin has denied. Musk wrote on his X platform on Friday that he's ""going to find out who's making these accusations and nuke them.""Russia's ambitions in the space domain pose a direct threat to US national security,"" the senators wrote.The Justice Department has said that Kiriyenko and other top officials were involved in an effort to seed Kremlin propaganda on social media, including on the Musk-owned X (formerly Twitter) platform to reducing international support for Ukraine and influence voters in the US presidential election.Musk, who backed Trump's successful 2024 election bid with millions of dollars, was picked by the president-elect earlier this week to lead a new Department of Government Efficiency.He has also participated in the incoming president's diplomatic efforts.Musk joined Trump's calls over the past week with Ukrainian President Volodymyrensky and Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan, as well as a meeting with Argentinian President Javier Milei at Trump's Florida home.The BBC's US partner, CBS News, reported on Friday that Musk recently visited the residence of Iran's United Nations ambassador in New York.It is not clear if Trump or his national security team were aware of the meeting.",Positive
