Putin proposes new rules for using nuclear weapons Russia's leader says strikes by a non-nuclear state aided by a nuclear power can be considered a joint attack,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5yjej0rvw0o,"– Vladimir Putin says Russia would consider an attack from a non-nuclear state that was backed by a nuclear-armed one to be a ""joint attack"", in what could be construed as a threat to use nuclear weapons in the war in Ukraine.In key remarks on Wednesday night, the Russian president said his government was considering changing the rules and preconditions around which Russia would use its nuclear arsenal.Ukraine is a non-nuclear state that receives military support from the US and other nuclear-armed countries.His comments come as Kyiv seeks approval to use long-range Western missiles against military sites in Russia. Putin said that Russia would consider such a ""possibility"" of using nuclear weapons if it detected the start of a massive launch of missiles, aircraft and drones into its territory, which presented a ""critical threat"" to the country's sovereignty.He added: ""It is proposed that aggression against Russia by any non-nuclear state, but with the participation or support of a nuclear state, be considered as their joint attack on the Russian Federation.""The country's nuclear arms were ""the most important guarantee of security of our state and its citizens"", the Kremlin leader said.Since the end of World War II, nuclear-armed states have engaged in a policy of deterrence, which is based on the idea that if warring states were to launch major nuclear strikes it would lead to mutually assured destruction.But there are also tactical nuclear weapons which are smaller warheads designed to destroy targets without widespread radioactive fallout.China has also called for calm, with reports President Xi Jinping has warned Putin against using nuclear weapons.",Negative

Wreckage shows how Titan's hull came apart Experts told the US Coast Guard on Wednesday there were safety problems with Titan's hull.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4g09gv4zg7o,"– An analysis of the wreckage of OceanGate's Titan submersible has revealed how its hull came apart.Images of the craft's pieces scattered across the sea floor show the carbon fibre hull had separated into multiple layers - a known problem with the material.The evidence was presented on Wednesday to the US Coast Guard at a public hearing into the catastrophic failure of the sub in June 2023, which killed all five people on board.It was not confirmed that the hull was the first part of the sub to fail, but the details suggest it is a key focus of the investigation.Titan, operated by OceanGate, imploded less than two hours into its descent during a dive to the wreckage of the Titanic.Titan's hull was made from numerous layers of carbon fibre mixed with resin.It's a highly unusual material for a deep sea sub because it is unreliable under pressure - most crafts are made from metals like titanium.Don Kramer, an engineer at the National Transportation Safety Board, showed the US Coast Guard a series of images of sections of the hull on the sea floor.He described how in some fragments, the carbon fibre layers had come apart - a known process called delamination.In other places, the material was cracked.It was not confirmed whether the damage to the hull had caused the implosion.Titan, operated by OceanGate, imploded less than two hours into its descent during a dive to the wreckage of the Titanic.Bill Kemper, of Kemper Engineering, had been asked to compile an independent report into the failure of Titan by the US Coast Guard.He concluded that at present the root cause for the failure was indeterminate.

Why Georgia could again be centre of an election storm A new Republican rule requiring a hand count of ballots turns the state election board into a political lightning rod.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwylnl02em1o,"– It was no ordinary meeting of Georgia's once-staid election board.The state panel gathered on Monday for its second all-day meeting to discuss new election rules, hurling accusations at one another while its nonpartisan chairman banged his mallet, calling for order.The five members had gathered to discuss last week's 3-2 vote to approve a rule that requires counties to hand count ballots on and after election night.In recent months, the panel's new Republican members have approved changes that have sparked warnings this pivotal battleground state could once again find itself at the center of confusion on and after Election Day.The new measure requires poll workers to hand count ballots on election night—or in some cases, the day after—to confirm that the number of paper ballots matches the amount tabulated by the machine.The state board was previously chaired by Georgia's secretary of state, but Raffensperger's fellow Republicans pushed him out after the 2020 election, a move critics say was revenge for his defense of the election results.Since then, several Trump-aligned Republicans have joined and won a majority on the board: Ms King, Ms Johnston and former Republican state senator Rick Jeffares.During meetings, the board's three new Republican members have advocated for a number of changes to the state's elections, including a rule passed earlier this year that allows local election boards to conduct ""reasonable inquiries"" into election results before certifying them.Ms King argues the rule will lead to ""an increase in certifications"" because board members can examine documents themselves.The new measure requires poll workers to hand count ballots on election night—or in some cases, the day after—to confirm that the number of paper ballots matches the amount tabulated by the machine.",Positive
