Hamas says it delivered 'positive response' on Gaza ceasefire plan The group said it was ready to begin negotiations immediately after Donald Trump said Israel had accepted conditions for a 60-day ceasefire.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cnvmrmvp98go,"– Hamas says it has delivered a ""positive response"" to mediators on the latest proposal for a new Gaza ceasefire and hostage release deal put forward by the US.The Palestinian armed group added in a statement that it was ""seriously ready to enter immediately into a round of negotiations.""A senior Palestinian official familiar with the talks told the BBC that Hamas accepted the general framework but had requested several key amendments, including a US guarantee that hostilities would not resume if talks on a permanent end to the 20-month war failed.The proposal is believed to include the staggered release of 10 living Israeli hostages by Hamas and the bodies of 18 other hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli jails.The proposal also reportedly says that sufficient quantities of humanitarian aid would enter Gaza immediately with the involvement of the UN and the International Committee of the Red Cross.The senior Palestinian official said Hamas was demanding that the aid be distributed exclusively by the UN and its partners, and that the controversial distribution system run by the Israel- and US-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) end immediately.Overnight, at least 15 Palestinians were killed in strikes on two tents housing displaced people in the southern Khan Younis area, the local Nasser hospital said.The proposal is believed to say that negotiations on ending the war would begin on day one.However, Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has ruled out ending the war until all of the hostages are released and Hamas's military and governing capabilities are destroyed.",Negative
"BBC on French beach as police slash migrant 'taxi-boat' heading to UK Watch video of French police destroying a boat in the English Channel in a rare and unusual intervention, which police have made clear is not a new tactic.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5ygjjxjlplo,"– French police have waded into shallow waters off a beach south of Boulogne and used knives to slash an inflatable small boat—packed with men, women and children—that was wallowing, dangerously, in the waves.All those onboard clambered to safety as the boat collapsed in chaotic scenes.The intervention was highly unusual. French police usually follow strict rules that bar them from going into the sea in case they put lives at risk.There had been some speculation that the French police—under growing pressure to stop a surge of small boat migrant crossings to the UK—are changing their tactics. But they have made it clear to the BBC that police have not adopted any new tactics in dealing with small boat launches, that the rules forbidding intervention in the water remains in place and officers must continue to prioritize safety on the beaches.The UK prime minister's official spokesman said the images of French police destroying a boat were ""a significant moment and we welcome this action.""We want to see tougher action taken, that's precisely the focus of our work, it is the outcome of that close work that you've seen,"" the spokesman said.",Positive

"Notorious Swedish gang leader arrested in Turkey Ismail Abdo, the leader of the Rumba crime gang, has been at the centre of a violent turf war with a rival gang in Sweden.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy0w4592znyo,"– One of Sweden's most wanted gang leaders, Ismail Abdo, has been arrested in Turkey, the Swedish prosecutor's office said on Friday.The dual Swedish-Turkish national has an extensive list of drug-related charges against him according to the global police agency, Interpol.The 35-year-old, nicknamed the Strawberry, is a well-known leader of the Rumba crime gang in Sweden. Swedish police did not identify him, but confirmed the arrest of a man ""suspected of having engaged in serious drug trafficking and inciting serious violent crimes"" for many years in Sweden.He was one of 19 people who were arrested during raids in Turkey, where officers seized more than a tonne of drugs, state broadcaster TRT reported.The increase in gang violence that has plagued some of Sweden's biggest cities and spread to quieter suburbs and towns has shattered its reputation as a safe and peaceful nation.Lat year, Sweden's security service, Sapo, accused Iran of recruiting Swedish gang members to carry out attacks on Israeli or Jewish interests.Gang violence in Sweden has escalated in recent years, in part because Abdo's former friend, Rawa Majida, is the leader of a rival gang, Foxtrot.An estimated 14,000 people in Sweden are caught up in criminal gangs, according to a police report last year, and a further 48,000 people are said to be connected to them.The escalation prompted the government to bring in the army to help tackle the surge in gang killings.",Negative
Trump signs sweeping tax and spending bill into law A signing ceremony at the White House on Friday afternoon kicked off celebrations for 4 July.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cpvjlj3n1vmo,"– President Trump has signed his landmark policy bill into law, a day after it was narrowly passed by Congress.The signing event at the White House on Friday afternoon enacts key parts of the Trump agenda including tax cuts, spending boosts for defense, and the immigration crackdown.There was a celebratory atmosphere at the White House as Trump signed the bill ahead of Independence Day fireworks and a military picnic attended by the pilots who recently flew into Iran to strike three nuclear sites. Trump told supporters it will unleash economic growth, but he must now convince sceptical Americans as polling suggests many disapprove of parts of the bill.The 870-page package includes:extending 2017 tax cuts of Trump's first termsteep cuts to Medicaid spending, the state-provided healthcare scheme for those on low incomes and the disablednew tax breaks on tipped income, overtime, and Social Securitya budget increase of $150bn for defensea reduction in Biden-era clean energy tax credits$100bn to Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE)Moments before the bill signing, there was a fly-by of a pair B-2 bombers—the same kind of aircraft that participated in the Iran operation— flanked by highly advanced F-35 and F-22 fighter aircraft.The bill passed by 218 votes to 214.Earlier this week, the Senate passed the bill but US Vice-President JD Vance was required to cast a tiebreaking vote after three Republicans held out.The White House believes the various tax cuts will help stimulate economic growth, but many experts fear that will not be sufficient to prevent the budget deficit—the difference between spending and tax revenue in any year—from ballooning, adding to the national debt.",Positive

US debt is now $37trn – should we be worried?,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1lj8rmyn5eo,"– The governor of the Bank of England recently told the BBC that the levels of US debt and the status of the dollar is ""very much on [US Treasury] Secretary Bessent's mind.I don't think the dollar is fundamentally under threat at the moment but he is very aware of these issues and I don't think it is something that he underestimates.""Debt of $37tn is an unfathomable number.If you saved a million dollars every day, it would take you 100,000 years to save up that much.The sensible way to look at debt is as a percentage of a country's income.The US economy produces income of around $25tn a year.While its debt to income level is much higher than many, it's not as high as Japan or Italy, and it has the benefit of the world's most innovative and wealth creating economy behind it.At home I have a book called Death of the Dollar by William F Rickenbacker in which he warns of the risks to the dollar's status as the world's reserve currency.Mr Rickenbacker is no longer with us - the dollar is.But it doesn't mean that its status and value is a divine right.",Positive
Kenyan leader to build huge church at presidential office,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clyzd9jg9ymo,"– Kenyan President William Ruto says he is building a church at the presidential residence in Nairobi that he will pay for himself—and says he has nothing to apologize for.""I am not going to ask anyone for an apology for building a church.

I found a church but one made out of iron sheets. Does that look befitting for the State House?"" a defiant Ruto told politicians at a meeting he hosted on Friday. Ruto said he would pay for the church out of his own pocket, however that raises the question of whether he has the right to build such a large structure on state-owned property.The Atheists Society of Kenya is threatening legal action to stop the church being built, calling it shocking and unacceptable.""We view this action as anti-democratic and a promotion of Christian nationalism by President Ruto. We want to remind him that Kenya does not belong to Christians only,"" said the group's head, Harrison Mumia.William Ruto is Kenya's first evangelical Christian president, cultivating a pious image and earning him the nickname of ""deputy Jesus.""I am not going to ask anyone for an apology for building a church.",Negative
