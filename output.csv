"When will we know who has won? Once polls close on Tuesday, a winner may not be projected for several hours, days or even weeks.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cde7ng85jwgo,"– The first polls will close at 18:00 EST (23:00 GMT) on Tuesday evening and the last polls will close at 01:00 EST (06:00 GMT) early on Wednesday.This race is expected to come down to results from seven swing states which experts believe could plausibly be won by Harris or Trump.The vote was held on 7 November, but the two campaigns went to war over a tight contest in Florida and the race was not decided until 12 December.In other recent elections, voters have had a much shorter wait.In 2016, when Trump won the presidency, he was declared the winner shortly before 03:00 EST (08:00 GMT) the day after the election.In 2012, when Barack Obama secured a second term, his victory was projected before midnight on polling day itself.However, the 2000 election between George W Bush and Al Gore was a notable exception.The vote was held on 7 November, but the two campaigns went to war over a tight contest in Florida and the race was not decided until 12 December.Michigan allows officials to begin counting votes one week before election day, but they are not allowed to reveal the results until these polls shut.This time, the tight race in many states could mean media outlets wait longer before projecting who has won.Democrat Kamala Harris, the current vice-president, and Republican Donald Trump, the former president, have been running neck-and-neck for weeks.",Positive

"All eyes are on Florida's abortion amendment Of all the US abortion ballot measures, the one in this conservative state will be most closely watched.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cd0glddvkk0o,"– The issue is also credited with helping the Democrats do better than expected in congressional races.Now, Democrats hope again that abortion measures in key battleground states like Arizona and Nevada will drive their voters to the polls to back abortion rights—and while they're at it, propel Vice-President Harris to the White House and their down-ballot candidates to victory. Florida's ballot question will be the most closely watched.If passed, Florida's measure - Amendment 4 - would overturn the six-week abortion ban currently in effect here and expand access to the point of foetal viability, which is about 24 weeks of pregnancy. Polls suggest a majority of Florida voters are backing Amendment 4. But the amendment must reach a 60% threshold to pass—and surveys are indicating that while it has strong support, the campaign might not quite meet that bar in the fairly conservative state.If it did pass, that would be viewed as a huge victory for the abortion-rights movement.“It’s important to vote based on our rights,” she said of her vote both for Kamala Harris and for expanding abortion access in Florida.Ms Linkhorst supported Trump's current position that abortion policy should be left to individual states, and she hoped Florida would reject any expansion beyond its current six-week ban.",Positive

An investigation later found the house belonged to a friend of Mr Hill's. Coy used a flashlight to spot Mr Hill in the garage and ordered him to come out. Police body camera footage showed Mr Hill then come out of the garage holding a mobile phone in his left hand, his right hand not visible, seconds before he was gunned down by Coy. ""We're taught do what the cops tell you to do and you can survive the encounter,"" said prosecutor Anthony Pierson during closing arguments. Coy did not visibly react to the verdict, according to AP News. Weeks after Mr Hill's shooting, the Columbus police chief resigned under mounting scrutiny over a series of fatal shootings of unarmed black men and children.",Negative
