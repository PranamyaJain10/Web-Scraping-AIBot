Qatar suspends role as mediator between Israel and Hamas The move comes after US officials were quoted saying they would not accept Hamas's presence in Qatar.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c774d4p2mx6o,"– Qatar has suspended its work as a mediator in ceasefire and hostage release talks between Israel and Hamas, officials say.The country said it would resume its work when Hamas and Israel ""show their willingness"" to negotiate.It comes after senior US officials reportedly said Washington would no longer accept the presence of Hamas representatives in Qatar, accusing the Palestinian group of rejecting fresh proposals for an end to the war in Gaza. Qatar said initial reports it had withdrawn from mediation talks and said that Hamas's political office in Doha ""no longer serves its purpose"" were ""inaccurate.""Qatar notified the parties 10 days ago during the last attempts to reach an agreement, that it would stall its efforts to mediate between Hamas and Israel if an agreement was not reached in that round,"" a statement from the Qatari foreign ministry said.The latest move comes as US officials appear increasingly frustrated with the approach the Israeli government has taken to ending the war.Hamas has had a base in the Qatari capital since 2012, reportedly at the request of the Obama administration.Several news agencies reported on Saturday that Qatar had agreed with the US to tell Hamas to close its political office in Doha due to ""a refusal to negotiate a deal in good faith.""Qatar said initial reports it had withdrawn from mediation talks and said that Hamas's political office in Doha ""no longer serves its purpose"" were ""inaccurate.""Israel has also been accused of rejecting deals.",Negative

Queen to miss Remembrance events after illness Buckingham Palace says the Queen hopes to return to public duties early next week.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clygq4j338go,"– Prince William on Thursday described the past year as the ""hardest year"" of his life following both his wife and his father being diagnosed with cancer.""I'm so proud of my wife, I'm proud of my father, for handling the things that they have done,"" he told reporters at the end of his visit to South Africa to promote his Earthshot eco-project.""But from a personal family point of view, it's been brutal.""The Queen will not join the rest of the Royal Family in attending the Festival of Remembrance at the Royal Albert Hall on Saturday evening or the Sunday service at the Cenotaph.King Charles, who is still receiving cancer treatment, will lay a wreath on behalf of the nation at the memorial in Whitehall, central London.The Queen had already withdrawn from events earlier in the week but it had been hoped she would be able to attend weekend Remembrance events.It is understood that there is no cause for alarm and no downturn in her condition, but that her doctors have advised a few more days of rest to enable a return to full health.Queen Camilla is said to be disappointed that she will be unable to pay tribute to the nation's fallen service personnel this weekend, but that she is mindful of minimizing the risk of passing on any lingering infection to the elderly veterans in attendance.The Queen missed the annual opening of the Field of Remembrance at Westminster Abbey on Thursday, where she was instead represented by the Duchess of Gloucester.She also withdrew from a Buckingham Palace reception reception for Olympic and Paralympic athletes, which was hosted by the King on Thursday evening.The Queen returned to the UK last Wednesday after a trip with the King to Australia and Samoa, which included a stopover in India on the way back.",Negative
"Return of unpredictable president puts UK defence spending top of agenda Politicians say we're living in dangerous times, and Trump is a lot less willing than Biden to pay for Europe's defence.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c9vnd17v2vmo,"– Donald Trump is a lot less willing than the current president to pay for other countries' defense.As one UK source told me, ""it doesn't make sense for Europe's defense interests to be dependent on a few thousand votes in Pennsylvania.""So Trump's return puts this question right to the top of the list.The UK government does plan, eventually, to hit the target the Conservatives committed to—of spending 2.5% of the size of the economy on defense, a level last hit back in 2010.But there's a defense review underway, and a spending review of every penny spent in Whitehall to get through first.They're expected to come one after the other, next spring.John Healey, the defense secretary, was granted an extra £3bn in the Budget, which is a chunky sum of money—but in terms of defense spending, not a transformative amount of cash.A former minister said: ""It's very hard to order for the years ahead—how long can we be talking, when the need is now?"" The government will not say when they expect to hit the 2.5% target—and won't commit to hitting it before the end of the Parliament in 2029—causing frustration in some quarters.The UK has committed nearly £8 billion to Ukraine—air defense missiles, drones, cruise missiles, tanks and ships, as well as clothing and personal equipment.Another former minister told me that funding ""is absolutely urgent—it is urgent to help Ukraine but the most urgent is where our forces are in danger—it's not hypothetical, in the Red Sea the Houthis are firing at our ships.""",Positive
"Trump ally says Ukraine focus must be peace, not territory Bryan Lanza tells the BBC there needs to be an ""honest conversation"" with Kyiv and returning Crimea is not a US priority.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/czxrwr078v7o,"– A former adviser to President-elect Donald Trump says the incoming administration will focus on achieving peace in Ukraine rather than enabling the country to gain back territory occupied by Russia.Bryan Lanza, who worked on Trump's 2024 presidential campaign, told the BBC the incoming administration would ask Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky for his version of a ""realistic vision for peace.""And if President Zelensky comes to the table and says, well we can only have peace if we have Crimea, he shows to us that he's not serious,"" he said. ""Crimea is gone.""A spokesperson for Trump distanced the incoming president from the remarks, saying Mr Lanza ""does not speak for him.""Trump's Democratic opponents have accused him of cosying up to Russian President Vladimir Putin and say his approach to the war amounts to surrender for Ukraine that will endanger all of Europe.Mr Lanza, a Trump political adviser during his 2016 and 2024 campaigns, did not mention areas of eastern Ukraine, but he said regaining Crimea from Russia was unrealistic and ""not the goal of the United States.""Putin loses most of his people in assaults at the front.What does this indicate? It is obvious that he wants to fight on,"" he said.""Ukraine has been offering peace since 2022 - there are quite realistic proposals.And it is Russia that must be made to hear that peace is needed and that peace must be reliable, so that there is simply no repetition of Russian strikes.""A spokesperson for Trump's transition team said Mr Lanza was ""a contractor for the campaign, but ""does not work for President Trump and does not speak for him.""",Positive
"Melania Trump, enigmatic first lady who might do it differently this time Described by some as an ""enigma"", Mrs Trump is expected to return to her White House duties ""on her own terms"".",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ce8d7k2dnnko,"– A day after her husband's big election night win, Melania Trump took to social media to address the nation.“The majority of Americans have entrusted us with this important responsibility,” she vowed, and urged Americans to rise above ideology for the sake of the country.It was a brief message, but suggested a shift in how the former first lady will approach the role this second time around. When Trump won his first presidency in 2016, his wife was initially absent from the White House, instead staying in New York with their young son.She appeared reticent, at times, with the traditions set out by first ladies that preceded her. But experts say that this time, Mrs Trump will likely be more deliberate with her approach to the largely undefined role of being America's First Lady.Born Melanija Knavs, the 54-year-old Slovenian-American former fashion model eventually traded a glamorous life in the gilded walls of Manhattan's Trump Tower for the confines of political life that came with the Oval Office, during a presidency that was often mired in controversy.Described by some as an ""enigma,"" Mrs Trump has preferred to be less public than her predecessors, giving fewer speeches both in the White House and on the campaign trail.She also spoke after the first assassination attempt on her husband, calling for unity and labeling the perpetrator a ""monster.""In a rare interview on Fox, she later accused his political opponents and the media of ""fuelling a toxic atmosphere"" that led to the attack.",Negative
"Irish man suspected of killing US nurse arrested in Hungary Mackenzie Michalski's body was hidden in woodland in the country's west, police say.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c86q4g51wpxo,"– A 37-year-old Irish man has been arrested in connection with the murder of an American nurse in Hungary, police say.Mackenzie Michalski, 31, from Portland, Oregon, was reported missing after a night out in Hungary's capital, Budapest, on Tuesday.Officers said the suspect was identified through CCTV footage and later confessed to killing Ms Michalski, but claimed her death had been an accident.In a statement, put out on Saturday, police said the man had attempted to conceal Ms Michalski's death by renting a car, putting her body in a suitcase and hiding it in woodland near the village of Szigliget in the country's west.Officers said the pair had met at a nightclub, danced together and then traveled to the man's rented apartment.He was arrested there on Thursday evening, and has been remanded in custody.",Negative
"Tens of thousands protest in Valencia over floods Protesters are demanding the resignation of the Valencia regional head, accusing him of mishandling the response to last month's floods.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvg4n614v32o,"– Tens of thousands of people have protested in Valencia against authorities' handling of recent deadly floods, demanding the resignation of regional head Carlos Mazn.Protesters chanted, ""we are stained with mud, you are stained with blood"" as they took to the streets on Saturday evening.More than 200 people died in the flooding, which was caused by torrential rain hitting Valencia and neighboring provinces in October. Angry protesters clashed with police towards the end of the demonstrations.Pictures show Valencia City Hall smeared with mud, while the Reuters news agency reports protesters throwing chairs and other objects.The city's mayor, Mara José Catal, posted pictures of broken windows and a video appearing to show a fire being started on social media, adding: ""Vandalism is not the solution.""Valencia City Council condemned ""vandalism"", saying the city had also been affected by the floods.Last week the king and queen of Spain were pelted with mud and other objects by angry protesters during a visit to the town of Paiporta, one of the worst affected. Government sources told the El Pas newspaper this was ""irrelevant"" and that Mazn was constantly informed of events.Mazn, of the conservative Popular Party, has defended his actions.",Negative

As he was in life.""She called him a ""truly poetic man"" with ""a deep knowledge of the arts"".""I will miss him so much and hope he haunts me once in a while,"" she added.The original film's sequel - Candyman: Farewell to the Flesh - set three years later sees Todd's iconic lead appear again in New Orleans, encountering a descendant of his daughter.The third film - Candyman: Day of the Dead - was released in 1999, but set in 2020 Los Angeles.Todd, and others from the 1992 film, reprised their roles in 2021.",Negative
"Somebody moved UK's oldest satellite, and no-one knows who or why",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cpwrr58801yo,"– Someone moved the UK's oldest satellite and there appears to be no record of exactly who, when or why why.In 1969, just a few months after humans first set foot on the Moon, Skynet-1A was put high above Africa's east coast to relay communications for British forces.When the spacecraft ceased working a few years later, gravity might have been expected to pull it even further to the east, out over the Indian Ocean.But today, curiously, Skynet-1A is actually half a planet away, in a position 22,369 miles above the Americas. Orbital mechanics mean it's unlikely the half-tonne military spacecraft simply drifted to its current location.Almost certainly, it was commanded to fire its thrusters in the mid-1970s to take it westwards.The Ministry of Defense said Skynet-1A was constantly monitored by the UK's National Space Operations Centre.It might be tempting to reach for a conspiracy theory or two, not least because it's hard to hear the name ""Skynet"" without thinking of the malevolent, self-aware artificial intelligence (AI) system in The Terminator movie franchise.But there's no connection other than the name and conjunction.""It's still relevant because whoever did move Skynet-1A did us few favours,"" says space consultant Dr Stuart Eves.""It's now in what we call a 'gravity well' at 105 degrees West longitude, wandering backwards and forwards like a marble at the bottom of a bowl.And unfortunately this brings it close to other satellite traffic on a regular basis.""The first Skynet satellite revolutionised UK telecommunications capacity, permitting London to securely communicate with British forces as far away as Singapore.However, from a technological standpoint, Skynet-1A was more American than British since the United States both built and launched it,"" remarked Dr Aaron Bateman in a recent paper on the history of the Skynet program, which is now on its fifth generation.",Positive
