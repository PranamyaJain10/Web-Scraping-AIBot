"European leaders set to hold emergency summit on Ukraine The UK PM, who is expected to attend, said it was a ""once in a generation moment for our national security"".",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c04nw1pg3k2o,"– European leaders are set to gather next week for an emergency summit on the war in Ukraine, in response to concerns the US is moving ahead with Russia on peace talks that will lock out the continent.Sir Keir Starmer, who is expected to attend the summit in Paris, said it was a ""once-in-a-generation moment for our national security"" and it was clear Europe must take a greater role in NATO.It comes after Donald Trump's special envoy to Ukraine said European leaders would be consulted but not take part in any talks between US and Russia over ending the war.Senior White House figures are also due to meet Russian and Ukrainian negotiators in Saudi Arabia in the coming days, US officials say.On Saturday, US Representative Michael McCaul told Reuters news agency.McCaul, chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, said he understood Zelensky had been invited to take part in the Saudi talks, which were aimed at arranging a meeting with Trump, Putin, and the Ukrainian president ""to finally bring peace and end this conflict.""It may be like chalk on the blackboard, it may grate a little bit, but I am telling you something that is really quite honest.""",Positive
Discordant Ukraine statements from Trump team leave allies anxious A cacophony from senior members of the US administration has sown confusion and alarm in Europe.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/crr0gkn1qlzo,"– US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth had stunned America's allies with a speech setting out what many saw as a series of concessions Ukraine would have to make to sign any peace deal with Russia brokered by President Trump.Hegseth said it was ""unrealistic"" to think Ukraine could win back its sovereign territory occupied by Russia, as was its demand for NATO membership, adding it was up to European and not US troops to keep the peace.The three days of to and fro gave some of the first major insights into Trump's evolving position on one of the most consequential issues he faces—Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine and his vow to end the war—and also into how his administration is formulating and messaging its foreign policy.The US secretary of state's position contained no trace of laying out limits for Ukraine in the way the defense secretary had done.The fallout from Hegseth's speech was put to President Trump—along with the commentary of a Republican senator who described it as a ""rookie mistake"", like something a pro-Putin pundit could have written.Had Trump been aware of what Hegseth was going to say? ""Generally speaking, yeah, generally speaking I was,"" said the president.",Positive

Navalny did his best to breathe new life into Russia's beleaguered opposition.A master of social media and of the anti-corruption agenda, he had real appeal, especially to a younger crowd.But in 2020 he was poisoned with a Novichok nerve agent and almost died.The politician's lifeless body, sprawled beneath fairy lights in the colors of the Russian flag, marked the start of a dark new era.""Inside Russia, it's not a matter of there being no one with the charisma of Navalny,"" Tatiana Stanovaya, senior fellow at the Carnegie Russia-Eurasia Centre says, explaining the lack of any new leader since his death.""We're talking about the complete criminalisation of opposition.""

What it means when Elon Musk brings his children to work You'll sometimes see one of his children on his shoulders as billionaire Elon Musk makes public appearances.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvgerr2jvkgo,"– Elon Musk's children have been to places many will never see.From meetings with foreign leaders to the control room of a SpaceX launch, Musk's children have debuted as constant sidekicks to their father's endeavors in tech, business and now, politics.But why do Musk's children tag along?""The inclusion of the kids in many public appearances is very much a politician move or a political move to make him seem a bit more personable (and) take a human approach to how the public views him,"" says Kurt Braddock, an American University professor of public communication.Still, Mr Braddock thought the decision to bring Musk's preschooler to the Oval Office was unusual.X appeared bored during the 30-minute press briefing as he mimicked his father, sat on the floor and received the occasional side glance and smile from the leader of the free world.Musk has had 12 children with three different women.His most-recognized son, X  A-12?, goes by ""Lil X"", the same letter Musk used to re-name Twitter when he purchased the social media company.The four-year-old has been dubbed an ""emotional support human"" by Musk himself.Walter Isaacson, the author of Musk's biography, said on The Diary of a CEO podcast that Musk is ""deeply committed"" to his children and is ""almost obsessed by them"".""With his own children, his lovers, his wives, there is the same intensity that is baked into everything he does,"" Mr Isaacson said.Despite being forced to wait for hours for attendees, the presence of Musk's children created an atmosphere that felt relaxed and even joyous.It was a departure from the stiff, far more formal events held by other companies for which the prospect of seeing an executive's very young children would have come across as odd.",Positive
Mapping China's influence around the Panama Canal A close-up look at Chinese projects that worry the White House.,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/resources/idt-943c9a5e-32c0-4eae-8abb-4d9c4c6eae1e,"– President Donald Trump has made repeated claims that China ""operates"" the Panama Canal in recent weeks and has threatened to take back the waterway to block what he sees as Beijing's increasing influence. A BBC Verify analysis shows that the US remains the main user of the canal, but Chinese involvement in infrastructure projects around the waterway—which is operated directly by Panama—has grown in recent years.""In terms of the day-to-day, I'm sceptical as to whether there's a direct line between Beijing and CK Hutchison, but in a time of a crisis or a conflict it would be relatively trivial for the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) to say we're going to use the ports,"" Henry Ziemer, an Americas specialist at the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), told the BBC. The US remains the main user of the canal, but Chinese involvement in infrastructure projects around the waterway—which is operated directly by Panama—has grown in recent years.

Growing up in a city that was part of China but that had retained many of its freedoms—she had thought Hong Kongers could talk about 'what we like and don't like' and 'could decide what Hong Kong's future looked like.'""I didn't tell them at the time because they didn't care [about politics],"" she says.China has been the leading country over the past decade trying to silence exiled dissidents around the world, according to a report this week.",Positive
Base full of mouldy food and secret documents: Iran’s rapid retreat from Syria,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cjw4egp7lwno,"– The fall of Bashar al-Assad's regime was brought about by a chain of events after Hamas's 7 October attack on Israel.That attack led to an escalation of Israeli air strikes against the IRGC and Iran-backed groups in Syria and a war against another key Iranian ally—the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah, whose leader was killed in an air strike.Multiple sources close to the IRGC told the BBC that most of the forces had to flee to Iraq, and some were ordered to go to Lebanon or Russian bases to be evacuated from Syria by the Russians.But the most crucial blow came from within: there was a rift between Assad and his Iran-linked allies, he says.""There was a complete breakdown of trust and military co-operation between them.IRGC-linked groups were blaming Assad of betrayal and believing that he is giving up their locations to Israel.""As we pass through Khan Shaykhun, we come across a street painted in the colors of the Iranian flag.It was evident that these headquarters were also evacuated.The base is a labyrinth of tunnels dug deep into white rocky hills.The roof of one of the corridors is draped in fabric in the colors of the Iranian flag and there are a few Persian books on a rocky shelf.They left behind documents containing sensitive information.Iran was Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's most critical ally for more than 10 years.It deployed military advisers, mobilised foreign militias, and invested heavily in Syria's war.Its elite Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps built deep networks of underground bases, supplying arms and training to thousands of fighters.But now the base has new occupants: two armed Uyghur fighters from Hayaat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), the Islamist militant group whose leader Ahmed al-Sharaa has become the new interim president of Syria.",Negative
