Csaba Virag, a spokesman for Ms Huang's family, said the thief had initially attempted to enter via a second floor window at around 17:00 GMT on 7 December.Marks that look like they were made with a screwdriver or crowbar were left behind.Mr Virag said he believes the noise could have been a staff entrance door banging in the draft created when the intruder opened the window, and that the thief closed the window quickly to avoid being given away.The intruder was then captured on CCTV cameras moving around the house above them, struggling to open cases containing expensive jewelry before putting items into his bag.Mr Virag said the intruder would have had to climb down onto a sink from the window, but moved ""like a cat"" to avoid making any marks on it or disturbing the cosmetic products it was littered with.Mr Virag said he heard a banging during that meeting but put it down to the strong winds outside.",Negative

"New bone test could rewrite British history, say scientists",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clyx9nv4mleo,"– From the end of the Roman occupation through the Anglo-Saxon and Viking invasions—a new way of testing DNA in ancient bones could force a rethink of key moments in Britain's early history, say researchers.Scientists could already track big alterations in DNA that occur over thousands or millions of years, helping us learn, for example, how early humans evolved from ape-like creatures.Now researchers can identify subtler changes over just hundreds of years, providing clues as to how people migrated and interacted with locals.They are using the new method to analyse human remains found in Britain, including from the time when Romans were replaced by an Anglo-Saxon elite from Europe.Prof Peter Heather, from Kings College London, who is working on the project with the developers of the new DNA technique at the Francis Crick Institute in London, said the new technique could be ""revolutionary.""The problem the researchers were trying to overcome is that a human's genetic code is extremely long— consisting of 3 billion separate chemical units.Spotting the small genetic changes in that code which occur over a few generations, for example, as a result of new arrivals interbreeding with the local population, is like looking for a needle in a haystack.As well as showing up interbreeding with different populations, embedded in the ancient DNA are hugely important details on how people coped with key historical moments, such epidemics, shifts in diet, Scandinavia, and industrialisation.Prof Heather wants to use it to investigate what he describes as one of European history's biggest mysteries: why central and eastern Europe changed from being Germanic speaking to Slavic speaking, 1,500 years ago.",Positive
