"Did Trump have the legal authority to strike Iran? Some lawmakers have called Trump's strikes on Iran ""unconstitutional"" - so did he have the authority to order them?",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4gkw04yze1o,"– President Trump's decision to launch military strikes on Iran without consulting Congress is raising some legal questions, including whether he should have consulted Congress first.Constitutional experts have said that Article II gives the president the authority to use military force in certain circumstances.But Republican Speaker of the House Mike Johnson defended the president, saying he ""evaluated that the imminent danger outweighed the time it would take for Congress to act"" and that there's ""tradition of similar military actions under presidents of both parties.""It does not appear that President Trump complied with this requirement,"" says John Bellinger, who was a legal adviser in the White House under President George W Bush, said: ""Over the last several decades, Congress has acquiesced more and more in presidential uses of military force for a variety of purposes without congressional authorisation.""President Obama went on an eight month campaign bombing Libya to take down the regime there.Constitutional experts have said that Article II gives the president the authority to use military force in certain circumstances.The last time Congress evoked this power was in 1942 after Japan bombed Pearl Harbor during the Second World War.President Obama authorized airstrikes in Libya without requesting permission from Congress, which his administration justified under Article II, as was the case for the mission to kill Osama Bin Laden in Pakistan in 2011.President Bill Clinton launched strikes in the Balkans in the 1990s without prior approval, and more recently, Joe Biden did the same when hitting Houthi targets in Yemen as well as in Syria during his presidency.Constitutional experts have said that Trump's actions were in line with the Constitution or whether he should have consulted Congress first.",Negative

US Supreme Court allows Trump to resume deportations to third countries The ruling hands a victory to the Trump administration in its pursuit of mass deportations.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy5wkrn99qpo,"– The US Supreme Court has cleared the way for President Donald Trump's administration to resume deportations of migrants to countries other than their homeland.

The case involves eight migrants from Myanmar, South Sudan, Cuba, Mexico, Laos and Vietnam, who were deported in May on a plane said to be heading for South Sudan. Trump brought the case to the justices after a Boston-based appeals court last month declined to block the lower court ruling.The original intervention by Judge Murphy, a Biden appointee, prompted the US government to keep the migrants in the Horn of Africa nation of Djibouti, where an American military base is located.The Department of Homeland Security said the ruling was ""a victory for the safety and security of the American people.""Monday's decision is another victory for the Republican president in his pursuit of mass deportations.Last month, the Supreme Court allowed Trump to end Temporary Protected Status for Venezuelan nationals, affecting about 350,000 migrants.In another ruling in May, the justices said the president could temporarily pause a humanitarian program that has allowed nearly half a million migrants from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela to stay in the US for two years.",Positive
First celestial image unveiled from revolutionary telescope The telescope should detect killer asteroids and may even find the ninth planet in our solar system.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cj3rmjjgx6xo,"– A powerful new telescope in Chile has released its first images, showing off its unprecedented ability to peer into the dark depths of the universe.In one picture, vast colorful gas and dust clouds swirl in a star-forming region 9,000 light years from Earth.The Vera C Rubin observatory, home to the world's most powerful digital camera, promises to transform our understanding of the universe.If a ninth planet exists in our solar system, scientists say this telescope would find it in its first year.It will also answer crucial questions about dark matter, the mysterious substance that makes up most of our universe.In a press conference on Monday, the observatory revealed that in 10 hours, the telescope detected 2,104 new asteroids and seven space objects close to Earth.All other space and ground surveys combined usually find about 20,000 asteroids in a year.This once-in-a-generation moment for astronomy is the start of a continuous 10-year filming of the southern night sky.""I personally have been working towards this point for about 25 years.For decades we wanted to build this phenomenal facility and to do this type of survey,"" says Professor Catherine Heymans, Astronomer Royal for Scotland.The camera inside the telescope will repeatedly capture the night sky for 10 years, every three days, for a Legacy Survey of Space and Time.At 1.65m x 3m, it weighs 2,800kg and provides a wide field of view.It has 3,200 megapixels (67 times more than an iPhone 16 Pro camera) and would require 400 Ultra HD TV screens to show a single image.The camera's very large mirrors will help scientists detect dangerous objects that suddenly stray near Earth, including asteroids like YR4 that scientists briefly worried early this year was on track to smash into our planet.",Positive

Brazilian media and the woman's family have identified her as 26-year-old Juliana Marins, who was hiking with a group when she disappeared around 06:30 local time on Saturday. Search and rescue attempts have so far been unsuccessful due to the extreme terrain and foggy weather, according to Indonesian authorities. Mount Rinjani park authorities said in a social media post that rescuers on Saturday had heard Ms Marins's screams for help. At the time she was safe, though she appeared to be in shock, they said.Drone footage and other clips filmed by hikers that have been circulating online and carried by Brazilian media also appear to show she was alive on Saturday. But later that day rescuers could not find her when they descended 300m (984ft) to where they believed she was located, nor did she respond when they called out to her.On Monday rescuers were able to locate Ms Marins again, who appeared to have had fallen even further, but had to stop work because of ""climate conditions"", according to the family.The Brazilian foreign ministry said in a statement that it was in touch with the Indonesian government and had sent two embassy employees to monitor the rescue efforts.Satyawan Pudmoko, an official from Indonesia's forestry ministry, said on Monday that climbers should prioritize their safety while hiking.In 2022 a Portuguese man died after falling off a cliff on the summit of Mount Rinjani.",Negative
