Trump's call with Putin exposes shifting ground on Ukraine peace talks Statements from both world leaders reveal two very different realities about ending the war in Ukraine.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4ge7jq0px2o,"– Last year, Donald Trump promised he would end the Ukraine War in ""24 hours."" Last week, he said that it would not be resolved until he and Russian President Vladimir Putin could 'get together' and hash it out in person.On Monday, the ground shifted again.Trump's frantic peace brokering hints at what he really wants aside Monday's rhetoric, it appears that Ukraine and Russia are set to continue some kind of talks—and talking in any form is progress after nearly three years of war.Trump is holding out the promise of reduced sanctions on Russia—and new trade deals and economic investment—as the enticement that will move Putin toward a peace agreement.But yesterday, Russia launched its largest drone strike of the war on Ukrainian cities, and Monday's call between the two world leaders makes clear that any ceasefire or peace deal still seems well over the horizon.Trump's frantic peace brokering hints at what he really wants aside Monday's rhetoric, it appears that Ukraine and Russia are set to continue some kind of talks—and talking in any form is progress after nearly three years of war.Trump is holding out the promise of reduced sanctions on Russia—and new trade deals and economic investment—as the enticement that will move Putin toward a peace agreement.But yesterday, Russia launched its largest drone strike of the war on Ukrainian cities, and Monday's call between the two world leaders makes clear that any ceasefire or peace deal still seems well over the horizon.",Positive

Lanez was stabbed 14 times by a fellow inmate in a California prison last week, an attack that caused both of his lungs to collapse. He was rushed to a hospital and is expected to recover. Lanez, whose legal name is Daystar Peterson, is serving a 10-year prison sentence for shooting another musician, Megan Thee Stallion, in 2020. The prison attack happened around 07:20 local time (15:20 GMT) on 12 May, said Pedro Caldern Michel of the state's corrections department. Lanez was convicted of shooting Megan Thee Stallion, whose legal name is Megan Pete, as they were leaving a 2020 pool party at reality star Kylie Jenner's Hollywood mansion.The case divided the hip-hop world, with rappers - including 50 Cent and Iggy Azalea - appearing to take sides in the conflict and some asking the court for leniency at Lanez's sentencing. Drake's song Circo Loco, a collaboration with 21 Savage, appeared to reference the case and imply that Megan lied about being shot. Lanez had seven US top 10 albums in the seven years before his conviction.",Negative

"Israel lets aid into Gaza after 11-week blockade but UN calls it 'drop in ocean' The UN's humanitarian chief welcomes the move but says it is only ""a drop in the ocean of what is urgently needed"".",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3d4kz8p00eo,"– Israel says it has allowed five UN lorries carrying humanitarian aid, including baby food, into the Gaza Strip after 11 weeks of blockade.The UN's humanitarian chief welcomed the move but stressed it was only ""a drop in the ocean of what is urgently needed"" by the 2.1 million Palestinians in the war-torn territory, where global experts are warning of a looming famine.Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said his decision to temporarily let in a ""minimal"" amount of food followed pressure from allies in the US Senate.""We must not reach a situation of famine, both from a practical and a diplomatic standpoint,"" he stressed in a video in response to criticism of the move in Israel. Netanyahu said food deliveries would continue only until the Israeli military and private companies had set up hubs to distribute aid under a US-backed plan rejected by the UN.The resumed Israeli bombardment and ground operation have reportedly killed more than 3,000 people and displaced 400,000 others, while the UN says the blockade has caused severe shortages of food, medicine, and fuel.Last week, the Hamas-run health ministry reported 57 children had died from the effects of malnutrition over the past 11 weeks, and an assessment by the UN-backed Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) warned half a million people faced starvation.",Negative
Is China the winner in the India-Pakistan conflict? Pakistan's Chinese-made fighter jets were battle tested for the first time during hostilities with India.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1w3dln352vo,"– The four-day conflict between arch-rivals India and Pakistan this month ended with a ceasefire and both claiming victory—but it now appears that China's defense industry might also be an unlikely winner.The latest flare-up began on 7 May when India launched attacks on what it called ""terrorist infrastructure"" inside Pakistan in response to the brutal killing of 26 people, mostly tourists by militants in Pahalgam on 22 April.Some of the experts have called this a ""Deep moment"" for the Chinese weapons industry, referring to January this year when the Chinese AI start-up shook US giants with its cost-effective technology.""The aerial fight was a big advertisement for the Chinese weapons industry.Until now, China had no opportunity to test its platforms in a combat situation,"" Zhou Bo, a retired senior colonel in the Chinese People's Liberation Army, told the BBC.The Beijing-based analyst said the outcome of the air duel showed ""China has some systems that are next to none.""It took the Indian planners by sheer surprise.They didn't probably envision the depth of co-operation in the modern warfare.Other experts, however, feel it's too early to declare the superiority of the fighter jet in the India-Pakistan conflict.Professor Walter Ladwig from the King's College in London said it was yet to be determined whether the Chinese jets had actually outmand the Indian Air Force (IAF) planes, particularly the Rafale.""In a standard military doctrine, you would suppress the enemy's air defenses and get air superiority before you struck ground targets.Instead, it appears the IAF's mission was clearly not to provoke any Pakistani military retaliation,"" he said.Mr Ladwig thought that the Indian pilots were given instructions to fly despite the fact that the entire Pakistani air defense was on high alert and their jets were already in the sky.",Negative

The Take It Down Act criminalises posting ""intimate images"" - real or AI-generated - online without an individual's consent and requires technology companies to remove the content within 48 hours.While the bill has received strong bipartisan support, some digital rights groups say it's too broad and could lead to censorship.The first lady has championed the bill since her husband began his second term, arguing children need to be protected from ""mean-spirited and hurtful online behavior.""Anyone who intentionally distributes explicit images without the subject's consent will face up to three years in prison,"" Trump said.The bill has been endorsed by Paris Hilton, the businesswoman and DJ, who called it ""a crucial step toward ending non-consensual image sharing online.""As currently drafted, the Act mandates a notice-and-takedown system that threatens free expression, user privacy, and due process, without addressing the problem it claims to solve,"" digital rights advocacy group Electronic Frontier Foundation said.",Positive
