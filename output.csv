How hurricane conspiracy theories took over social media The misinformation has been fuelled by a social media universe that rewards engagement over truth.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1e8q50y3v7o,"– A deluge of misinformation online about back-to-back hurricanes in the US has been fuelled by a social media universe that rewards engagement over truth.The scale and speed of false rumors about Hurricane Helene and Hurricane Milton has been unlike many of the frenzies I've investigated online before.Viral posts have ranged from seemingly innocuous questions about the legitimacy of forecasts and rescue efforts, to false claims - repeated by Donald Trump - that hurricane relief funds are being spent on migrants who entered the US illegally.Others spread false images of the wreckage - faked pictures of children fleeing devastation that were generated by artificial intelligence (AI), old clips showing different storms or computer-generated (CGI) videos.Most of the viral misinformation has come from social media profiles which have blue ticks and a track-record for sharing conspiracy theories.While Wild Mother, and people like her, choose to view this as a sign that'more and more people are waking up to reality', I see it as a sign that these conspiracy theories are gaining a wider audience.This ultimately comes down to the way the algorithms across social media sites favor engagement above all else.",Positive
