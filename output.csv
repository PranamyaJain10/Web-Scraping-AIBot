"Four key takeaways from newly released JFK files Experts praised a move towards transparency, but there are no major revelations in the documents - and some still have yet to be released.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cly676jp291o,"– President Trump on Tuesday ordered the release of 2,352 documents related to John F. Kennedy's assassination, and the Guardian reports that more than 2,000 documents related to the investigation into President John F. Kennedy's assassination are notable not just for what they contain—but for what is omitted.As many experts expected, this latest release by the Trump administration does not answer all lingering questions about one of the turning points in American history—the 1963 slaying of Kennedy in Dallas.Nor do they fundamentally shift the understanding of what happened that day.There is no'smoking gun'.But this latest batch does include documents that are now mostly or fully unredacted—original material is included instead of blacked-out or replaced by blank space.The memo is also notable for one of the names in it—James McCord, who would later gain infamy as one of the men who burgled the Watergate complex.The CIA describes a system to secretly tag and identify public phone boxes that are tapped, using a paint only visible under ultraviolent light.Mr Underhill reportedly claimed that a cabal of CIA agents was behind the assassination, a theory openly published in Ramparts, a left-wing magazine, in 1967.Mr Underhill's death in 1964 was ruled a suicide, but the magazine cast doubt on that as well.Photos of a seven-page memo regarding Mr Underhill went viral on Tuesday—but the bulk of it is not new.Some well-known online accounts claimed that the recent documents reveal new details about long-alleged plots against Kennedy—even though some of the supposed revelations have been public for years.",Negative
Will Trump's tariff war spark big-bang reforms in India? Could this be a chance for the world’s fifth-largest economy to shed protectionism and open up further?,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cd0nr05yxmzo,"– India has usually turned to economic reforms in times of distress, with the most famous example being 1991, when the country embraced liberalisation in the face of a deep financial crisis. Now, with US President Donald Trump's tit-for-tat tariff wars and the global trade upheaval that has followed, many believe that India finds itself at another crossroad.Could this be a major opportunity for the world's fifth largest economy to shed its protectionism and further open up its economy? Will India seize the moment, just as it did more than three decades ago, or will it retreat further? Trump has repeatedly branded India a ""tariff king"" and a ""big abuser"" of trade ties.India's trade-weighted import duties - the average duty rate per imported product - are among the highest in the world.The US average tariff is 2.2%, China's is 3% and Japan's is 1.7%.India's stands at a whopping 12%, according to data from the World Trade Organization.India's rapid growth from the late 1990s to the 2000s - 8.1% between 2004-2009 and 7.46% from 2009-2014 - was in large part driven by its gradual integration into global markets, particularly in pharmaceuticals, software, autos, textiles and garments, alongside a steady reduction in tariffs.China can afford this strategy due to its massive export base, but we can't, as we hold only a small share of the global market, Raj Sengupta, an associate professor of economics at Mumbai-based Indira Gandhi Institute of Development Research, said.",Negative
