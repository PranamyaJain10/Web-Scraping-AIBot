They will be hoping to avoid a repeat of last year when they made the same trip and lost.For over 30 years, the winner of the National Hockey League's top prize has gone to an American team.Ms Duggan likes to think it's at least partly because of ice hockey's uniquely egalitarian gameplay - players are only on the ice for 45 seconds at a time, typically, which means that even a star player, like the Oiler's captain Connor McDavid, can't monopolise the rink.The international rivalry really came to a head during the winter's 4 Nations Face Off, when Trump was repeatedly making digs at Canada by calling it the ""51st state.""Ms Duggan grew up in rural Alberta and now lives in the US.Last year, the Oilers flopped during the final game of the seven-game series against the Florida Panthers.It was a ""heartbreaking"" loss for Carson Duggan, who grew up in rural Alberta and now lives in the US.Ms Duggan likes to think it's at least partly because of ice hockey's uniquely egalitarian gameplay - players are only on the ice for 45 seconds at a time, typically, which means that even a star player, like the Oiler's captain Connor McDavid, can't monopolise the rink.Now Edmonton has a second chance at breaking the losing streak this year, but heading into Game 6, there are concerns that history could indeed repeat itself.",Positive
What the capsizing and relaunching of a warship tells us about North Korea's regime The intrigue has less to do with the failure itself and more with how Kim Jong Un reacted.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c9898zjgq2ro,"– When North Korea's new warship capsized into the sea during its launch last month, it made international headlines.But why such interest, given there were no casualties, and the damage to the hull appeared relatively minor?The intrigue has less to do with the failure itself and more with how Kim Jong Un reacted.Kim immediately denounced the failure as ""a criminal act"" that ""could not be tolerated"", saying it had damaged the country's ""dignity.""This furious outburst, followed by the ship's swift repair, teaches us a lot about the North Korean regime, whose moves are often so difficult to decipher.The ship capsized as it was launched sideways from the dock into the sea—a complicated maritime maneuver—and part of the bow got stuck on the launching ramp.But rather than present this as a technical failure, Kim Jong Un claimed the incident was caused by ""absolute carelessness and irresponsibility.""The leadership decided it was almost silly to try and hide what people already knew, and much more effective to show people they were dealing with problems,"" Ms Lee said.""Now, when there's a problem, you publicise it, you call out those responsible, and demonstrate to people that if you don't do your job, you will be held accountable.This furious outburst, followed by the ship's swift repair, teaches us a lot about the North Korean regime, whose moves are often so difficult to decipher.",Negative

During the two-week trial, Lindell stuck by baseless claims that the election was stolen from Donald Trump. Dominion itself has filed cases against several Trump allies who it accuses of spreading lies about the company's voting machines. Coomer filed federal lawsuits in 2022 against Mr Lindell and two of his companies, MyPillow, Inc and Lindell TV, saying their actions had caused his reputation to be ""irreparably tarnished.""He ""now endures frequent credible death threats and the burden of being made the face of an imagined criminal conspiracy of unprecedented scope in American history"", his lawsuit said.A lawyer for Mr Coomer told the Colorado Sun: ""We're thrilled with the verdict.""""In the sense that [Coomer has] been through a lot and he's still going to be looking over his shoulder,"" added the attorney, Charles Cain.""Generally, what this verdict says is... individuals who are singled out can get vindication in the courthouse.And hopefully this serves as deterrence for individuals working on our elections from being targeted.""Outside court, Lindell praised the jury for not finding his company, Lindell TV, liable for defamation.He also vowed to appeal against the verdict and said he was in financial debt.In several major US shops stopped carrying Mr Lindell's products as he began endorsing election conspiracies.",Negative
Trump Organization enters mobile phone business,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cjrld3erq4eo,"– Donald Trump's family business is launching a new Trump-branded phone service, in its latest plan to cash in on the US president's name.

Technology experts have questioned what the Trump Organization's ""built in the United States"" claim about its handsets means and argued it is probably not currently possible to manufacture smartphones from scratch in the US.""They don't even have a working prototype.You would have to have a miracle. You would need to have economies of scale.You would need to have sustainable demand for this kind of product,"" Prof Dai added.The announcement was light on details, including the name of the business partner that will run the service and is licensing the name.The Trump Organization did not immediately respond to questions from the BBC about its business partner, criticisms around potential ethics issues and a request for details of its 'built in the United States' claim.'",Positive
Where is Israel's operation heading?,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ce829v2qzyro,"– Israel's military operations were, he announced, ""clearing the path for you to achieve your freedom."" Now, as the military confrontation between Iran and Israel intensifies, and the range of targets widens, many are asking—what is Israel's real endgame? Is it simply to end, as Netanyahu also declared on Friday on the first night of strikes, ""the Islamic regime's nuclear and ballistic missile threat""?Was it also to finish off any more talks between the US and Iran, to reach a new negotiated deal to curb Iran's nuclear program in exchange for the lifting of painful sanctions?Or could that message to Iranians about clearing a path to achieve freedom nod to an even bigger aim of trying to bring an end to Iran's clerical rule? The political career of Israel's longest-serving prime minister has been marked by his personal mission to warn the world of the dangers posed by the Islamic Republic of Iran—from a cartoon of a bomb he's shown at the United Nations, to his repeated refrain during the last 20 months of a burning regional war that Iran was the biggest threat of all.Iran is also hitting back with its own expanding hit list as civilian casualties mount in both countries. But to deal a decisive blow to Iran's vast nuclear program, Israel would have to do significant damage to Fordow, its second-largest and most heavily protected site. Israel doesn't have the bunker-busting bombs it would need to smash through so much rock.",Negative
