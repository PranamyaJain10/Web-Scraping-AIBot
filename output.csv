"Battered but defiant -  where does Hezbollah go from here? Can the group survive a wave of changes in Lebanon, and the re-shaping of power in the Middle East?",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cp82pm3exz0o,"– On 26 January, thousands of displaced Lebanese, who had been living across the country, tried to return to their homes in southern Lebanon.They traveled in convoys, played revolutionary songs and waved, proudly, the yellow Hezbollah flag. Many found out that, aer more than a year of war, there were no homes to return to. The date marked the end of a deadline for the withdrawal of Israeli troops, part of a ceasefire brokered by the US and France, that required Hezbollah to remove its weapons and fighters from the south. But Israel said Lebanon had not fully implemented the deal and, as a result, not all invading forces pulled out. The latest conflict started in October 2023, when Hezbollah opened a second front against Israel as Israel launched a war in Gaza in response to the Hamas attacks. An unrelenting air campaign and subsequent invasion of the south killed more than 4,000 people including many civilians, left areas with a significant presence of Shia Muslims—which form the bulk of Hezbollah's support—in ruins, and severely damaged the group's arsenal.Over the years, Hezbollah, the Shia Muslim militia, political and social movement, cemented its position as Lebanon's most powerful group. But can the group survive a wave of changes in Lebanon, and the re-shaping of power in the Middle East?",Negative
