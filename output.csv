"Trump says 'hand of God leading me', while Harris tries to woo Republicans Trump speaks to evangelical Christians in North Carolina, while the VP tours swing states with ex-Republican lawmaker Liz Cheney.",https://www.bbc.com/news/live/cpdqw2yd00dt,"– Donald Trump spoke to evangelical Christians in Concord, North Carolina during his last event of the day. Among the dozens of people in the crowd he singled out to mention was former Republican presidential candidate Ben Carson, who Trump said told him in 2016 that God had selected him as the next US president. Towards the end of his remarks, he spoke at length about the assassination attempt against him on 13 July in Butler, Pennsylvania, saying he felt as though he had been ""knocked to the ground by a supernatural hand."" He also claimed, without evidence, that the FBI has been sending ""spies"" into Catholic churches. Trump is using the final days of this campaign to try and appeal to religious Americans, including Catholics, evangelicals and Jews, in the final days of his campaign.",Negative
Musk is giving some US voters $1m. Is it legal? Two voters have already picked up their lottery-style cheques for a million dollars from Elon Musk.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ced0d1g5zyno,"– Elon Musk's campaign group America PAC, which was set up to support Donald Trump in the presidential contest, is offering cash sums for simply signing the petition. Voters in Pennsylvania are being offered cash sums for simply signing the petition.Constitutional law professor Jeremy Paul, with Northeastern University School of Law, said in an email to the BBC that Mr Musk is taking advantage of a legal loophole.He pointed to the US Code on electoral law, which states that anyone who ""pays or offers to pay or accepts payment either for registration to vote or for voting"" faces a potential $10,000 fine or a five-year prison sentence.But legal experts have suggested that it may break American law to offer money for an act requiring someone to be signed up as a voter.The petition was created by Mr Musk's campaign group America PAC, which was set up to support Donald Trump in the presidential contest.Each day until polling day on 5 November, a $1m prize will be randomly awarded to any signatory in one of the seven swing states.I understand some analysis that it's not illegal, but I think here combined with the context it's clearly designed to induce people to register to vote in a way that is legally problematic,"" Michael Kang said.Mr Musk's scheme ""violates federal law and is subject to civil or criminal enforcement by the Department of Justice""",Positive
"'Not my king': Why an Australian senator heckled King Charles Lidia Thorpe explained why she heckled the monarch to the BBC's Katy Watson, on his second day of engagements.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx2k2de0x9po,"– A lawmaker in Australia who called the late Queen a coloniser has been kicked out of Parliament after heckling Prince Charles. Lidia Thorpe, who is now an independent after leaving the Greens over the party’s support for the Yes vote in the referendum—is unlikely to change tack. She thinks the King needs to play a bigger role in making good the ills of the past.Last year's referendum on a Voice to Parliament—which would have recognized First Nations people in the constitution and allowed them to form a body to advise the parliament—was a distraction from that goal. Australians resoundingly voted against the proposal and she was one of a minority of First Nations people who also voted no.She told the BBC at the time that the Voice was about ""assimilating us into the colonial constitution to make us nice, neat little Indigenous Australians that will continue to be oppressed by the coloniser.""I wanted to send a clear message to the King of England that he's not the King of this country, he's not my king, he's not sovereign,"" Thorpe told the BBC after being removed from the Great Hall after heckling.Whether or not you agree with Lidia Thorpe's approach—and some prominent Indigenous leaders have made it clear that they don't—the fact is that there are deep disparities between First Nations people and non-Indigenous Australians when it comes to indicators such as education, health, and life expectancy.Last year Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said a young Indigenous man was more likely to go to jail than university, which is borne out by statistics, as ABC showed.",Positive
Guilty pleas over killing of man acquitted in 1985 Air India bombings Two hitmen entered guilty pleas of second-degree murder over the 2022 shooting in Canada of Ripudaman Singh Malik.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckg2grke83yo,"– Two hitmen have pleaded guilty in a Canadian court over the shooting of a man acquitted of the 1985 bombing of an Air India flight.Tanner Fox and Jose Lopez pleaded guilty to the second-degree murder of Sikh businessman Ripudaman Singh Malik in 2022.They entered their pleas in British Columbia Supreme Court on the eve of their trial for first-degree murder.In a shocking development, a ferocious fist fight then broke out between Fox and Lopez in the courtroom in New Westminster.Malik was shot several times in his car outside his family business in Surrey, British Columbia, on the morning of 14 July 2022.Police found a burnt-out vehicle nearby.The businessman had been acquitted in 2005 of a devastating double bomb attack:On 23 June 1985, Air India flight 182 from Canada to India blew up off the Irish coast, killing all 329 people on board, most of them Canadian citizens visiting relatives in India About the same time, a second bomb exploded prematurely in Japan, killing two baggage handlersThe bombings - widely believed to have been carried out by Canadian-based Sikhs in retaliation for India's deadly 1984 storming of the Golden Temple, the holiest shrine in the Sikh religion - remain Canada's deadliest terror attack.Following a two-year trial, Malik and his co-accused, Ajaib Singh Bagri, were both acquitted of mass murder and conspiracy charges related to the two bombings.According to the agreed statement of facts on Monday, Fox and Lopez were contracted to kill Malik but the evidence did not establish who had hired them.Fox's lawyer declined to comment on the case.",Negative
Mega meteorite tore up seabed and boiled Earth's oceans It was 200 times bigger than the one that wiped out the dinosaurs nearly three billion years later.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4g4g455p8lo,"– A huge meteorite first discovered in 2014 caused a tsunami bigger than any in known human history and boiled the oceans, scientists have discovered.The space rock, which was 200 times the size of the one that wiped out the dinosaurs, smashed into Earth when our planet was in its infancy three billion years ago.Carrying sledge hammers, scientists hiked to the impact site in South Africa to chisel off chunks of rock to understand the crash.The team also found evidence that massive asteroid impacts did not bring only destruction to Earth - they helped early life thrive. ""We know that after Earth first formed there was still a lot of debris flying around space that would be smashing into Earth,” says Prof Nadja Drabon from Harvard university, lead author of the new research.“But now we have found that life was really resilient in the wake of some of these giant impacts, and that it actually bloomed and thrived.""Imagine a rain cloud, but instead of water droplets coming down, it's like molten rock droplets raining out of the sky,” says Prof Drabon.A huge tsunami would have swept across the globe, ripped up the sea floor, and flooded coastlines.The 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami would have paled in comparison, suggests Prof Drabon.All that energy would have generated massive amounts of heat that boiled the oceans causing up to tens of meters of water to evaporate.The team also found evidence that early life was actually helped by the violent succession of rocks striking Earth in its early years, Prof Drabon says.“It seems that life after the impact actually encountered really favorable conditions that allowed it to bloom,” she explains.",Positive
What leaked US assessment of Israeli plans to strike Iran shows US investigators are trying to find out how the highly classified intelligence documents were leaked online.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cz6w6p8x7p8o,"– Israel has been vowing to hit Iran hard in retaliation for Iran's massed ballistic missile attack on Israel on 1 October.Iran says that was in response to Israel's assassination of the Hezbollah leader, Hassan Nasrallah, on 27 September.The White House National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said President Joe Biden was ""deeply concerned"" about the leak.The documents appear to have been circulated to intelligence agencies in the Five Eyes alliance, the five Western nations that regularly share intelligence, namely the US, UK, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand.The US has made no secret of its opposition to the targeting of either Iran's nuclear research facilities or its oil installations.The significance of this is that it would indicate that the Israeli Air Force is planning to carry out a similar but greatly expanded version of its ABLM attack on an Iranian radar site near Isfahan in April.The documents also report no sign of any preparations by Israel to activate its nuclear deterrent.Israel has been vowing to hit Iran hard in retaliation for Iran's massed ballistic missile attack on Israel on 1 October.Iran says that was in response to Israel's assassination of the Hezbollah leader, Hassan Nasrallah, on 27 September.The US has made no secret of its opposition to the targeting of either Iran's nuclear research facilities or its oil installations.That leaves military bases, most likely those belonging to Iran's Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) and its affiliated Basij militia as these two institutions are seen as the backbone of the Islamic Republic, projecting its military reach abroad and suppressing popular protest at home.",Negative

"Moscow had high hopes for Trump in 2016. It's more cautious this time The race for the White House presents Vladimir Putin with a dilemma, writes the BBC's Steve Rosenberg.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4g95r3lnr2o,"– President Vladimir Putin has even come out and backed the Democratic Party candidate, although that ""endorsement"" was widely interpreted as a Kremlin joke (or Kremlin trolling).Putin claimed he liked Kamala Harris's ""infectious"" laugh.But you don't need to be a seasoned political pundit to understand that out on the campaign trail it's what Trump has been saying, not Harris, that's guaranteed to put a smile on Putin's face.In November 2016, Russian ultranationalist politician Vladimir Zhirinovsky was so excited by Donald Trump's victory, and so sure that it would transform US-Russian relations, he splashed out on 132 bottles of bubbly down at the Duma, Russia's parliament, and partied away (in his party offices) in front of the TV cameras.He wasn't the only one celebrating.Which is why, eight years on - publicly at least - Russian officials are more cautious about the prospect of a second Trump term.",Positive
Officer reveals how he locked eyes with would-be Trump assassin,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvgdgl5p40yo,"– A local police officer locked eyes with Donald Trump's would-be assassin as he perched on a roof near the rally site—but there is no evidence a warning about the gunman reached the Secret Service before the shooting, a new report says. A US House of Representatives task force on Monday published preliminary findings into the July assassination attempt at a Pennsylvania rally, outlining a list of security failings.The report from the bipartisan panel states that the attempt was ""preventable and should not have happened.""The committee's investigation is ongoing, and it is also looking into a second suspected attempt on Trump's life at his Florida golf course in September.",Negative
Central Park Five sue Trump for defamation over debate claims,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cdrjrd70286o,"– Five men wrongly convicted of attacking a jogger in Central Park decades ago have sued Donald Trump, accusing him of making ""false and defamatory"" statements during a recent presidential debate.The lawsuit claims Trump defamed the men during the debate in September when he said they confessed and pleaded guilty to crimes they were falsely accused of.The plaintiffs, known as the Central Park Five - Yusef Salaam, Raymond Santana, Kevin Richardson, Antron Brown, and Korey Wise - were teenagers who pleaded not guilty to rape and assault in the 1989 case. They were wrongfully convicted, but exonerated in 2002 after serving years in prison.The lawsuit, which was filed Monday, cites several statements Trump made after opponent Kamala Harris attacked him for buying ads that called for the death penalty at a time when the public was consumed by the case.Mr Salaam replied, ""No, no, no, I'm not on your side.""The lawsuit alleges that Trump made the comments ""negligently"" and ""with reckless disregard for their falsity.""The case consumed New York City for years, exposing deep fault lines around race, crime, and inequality in the criminal justice system.Mr Salaam, one of the Central Park Five who is a currently a member of the New York City Council, attended the September presidential debate.",Negative
