"How Trump is using the 'Madman Theory' to try to change the world (and it's working) Political scientists have a term for the tactic, that has been used by some leaders including Nixon, to persuade adversaries that they are temperamentally capable of anything, to extract concessions. But can it work in the long term?",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/czxww2kez0go,"– The most predictable thing about Trump is his unpredictability. He changes his mind. He contradicts himself.
