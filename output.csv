Trump announces 25% tariffs on car imports to US The US President says the tariffs on cars will come into effect on 2 April and car parts a month later.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cly341xr45vo,"– President Trump has announced new import taxes of 25% on cars and car parts coming into the US in a move that threatens to widen the global trade war.Trump said the latest tariffs would come into effect on 2 April, with charges on businesses importing vehicles starting the next day.The president claimed the measure would lead to ""tremendous growth"" for the car industry, promising it would spur jobs and investment in the US.But analysts have said the move is likely to lead to the temporary shutdown of significant car production in the US, increase prices, and strain relations with allies.The US imported roughly eight million cars last year, accounting for about $240bn in trade and roughly half of overall sales. Mexico is the top foreign supplier of cars to the US, followed by South Korea, Japan, Canada, and Germany.",Positive
Six lingering questions about Trump officials' Signal chat Lawmakers and the press are seeking answers as the incident has left many wondering about the breadth and depth of the controversy.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5y41xdrxnyo,"– President Trump's national security adviser has faced the most calls to resign, and some cabinet officials have said that their process will go under review.Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who was also in the group, said on Wednesday that someone had made a ""mistake"" in adding Mr Goldberg.Trump is a Republican, and both chambers of Congress - the House of Representatives and the Senate - are controlled by his party.Hegseth has denied sharing classified material, but experts are sceptical that this type of sensitive information would not carry that kind of designation.The Atlantic then on Wednesday published the entire text thread that showed the detailed and potentially classified rundown for a March strike on Yemen after Mr Goldberg and the publication faced pushback from the Trump administration.Trump told reporters in the Oval Office on Wednesday that he has not lost confidence in his national security adviser.Hegseth also appears safe from Trump's ire for now.""I think there'll be reforms and changes made,"" Rubio told reporters on Wednesday.Democratic lawmakers are calling for resignations, but at the moment, none of the officials involved in the Signal chat have stepped down.White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Wednesday that ""no war plans"" were discussed on the chat.Mr Goldberg reports that he received a message from Waltz, which also noted one of his deputies was ""pulling together"" a team of top staffers relevant to the discussion.Secretary of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard told lawmakers during a congressional hearing that the Signal chat was ""candid and sensitive"" but ""no classified information was shared.""But under questioning, she and CIA Director John Ratcliffe appeared uncertain about the classification of the attack plan.It remains to be seen whether Congress will launch oversight, which it has the power to pursue.",Negative
Why leaving his own charity will matter so much to Prince Harry The prince's exit from Sentebale after an internal row has echoes of his decision to step back as a royal.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx2xeyn0lvvo,"– It was Sunday, 19 January 2020.All attempts to negotiate a new role for the Duke and Duchess of Sussex within the royal family had failed, and Harry and Meghan were about to head off to a new life in the United States.Prince Harry made one final speech about how he was feeling.He delivered it at a dinner for his beloved Sentebale charity.Sentebale means ""forget-me-not"" in Sesotho, the language of Lesotho.Back at that Sentebale dinner in 2020, he told guests: ""When I lost my mum... you took me under your wing. You looked out for me for so long.""The connection to Diana, Princess of Wales, is an important personal part of the Sentebale story.His joint founder, Prince Seeiso of Lesotho, had also lost his mother.They were both motivated by a sense of loss.Prince Harry has walked away in what has clearly been a catastrophic breakdown in the trustees' relationship with the chair of the board.There has been a personal fallout, a wrangle over the charity's future direction, and broken relationships with damaging accusations being made.Prince Harry has been here before.",Negative
"'Yoh! You're in the OED' – South Africa makes its linguistic mark The latest update to the Oxford English Dictionary includes ""loan words"" from several countries, including South Africa and Ireland.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx2er7qwz31o,"– It means: Wow, I'm so annoyed by this prison and need to smoke some marijuana to handle these irrational people.These popular words are among a slew of ""untranslatable words"", defined by the OED as ""words and phrases in one language that cannot be translated into another"", featured in the latest lexicon.Other ""loan words"" included in the update come from the Philippines, Malaysia, Singapore, and Ireland.The list of South African words come from several of the country's 12 official languages and they are:Yoh: A popular South African interjection, which the OED traced to 1855.It means: Wow, I'm so annoyed by this prison and need to smoke some marijuana to handle these moggy people.Gatvol: Another popular slang term originating from Afrikaans and used to express ""feelings of frustration and anger.""Zol: This term, of unknown origin, is popular in South African slang and refers to marijuana, the drug itself, or ""hand-rolled cigarette containing marijuana.""Seshweshwe or shweshwe: This comes from Southern SeSotho and refers to a ""type of printed cotton fabric, originally dyed with indigo but now available in various colors"", according to the OED.Sharp-sharp: The last, and arguably most well-known, phrase featured in the OED's latest quarterly update can be traced back to 1991.",Negative
Noem visits mega-jail holding deported Venezuelans The visit by the US Homeland Security secretary is seen as a show of support for the Salvadorean leader.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cj4nrdnp018o,"– Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem has visited a controversial mega-prison in El Salvador, to which US officials sent 238 Venezuelans. The Trump Administration alleges that the men are members of Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua and had them deported to El Salvador under the 1798 Alien Enemies Act.The move has prompted an outcry in the US and Venezuela, with several family members of the deportees insisting their relatives do not belong to any gang. Noem's visit to the country, and to the jail known as Terrorism Confinement Centre (Cecot) in particular, is seen as a show of support for Salvadorean President Nayib Bukele, as pressure against housing deportees at the prison grows. The deportations to El Salvador under Trump's second term are part of the president's long-running campaign against illegal immigration in the US.An appeals court in Washington DC upheld a decision by a lower court to put a temporary injunction on the deportation of Venezuelan immigrants under the 1798 act, which allows for the expulsion of foreign citizens with little due process.The use of the act has drawn an outcry from immigration lawyers and activists who argue that some men accused of being gang members have been sent to El Salvador and locked up in the mega-prison on the basis of little evidence, including simply having tattoos.Human rights groups have warned that the jail, in which inmates are held in windowless cells and sleep on bare metal bunks, is a ""concrete and steel pit.""",Negative

Zelensky hopes US will 'stand strong' in face of Russian demands The Ukrainian president was answering questions from a panel of European journalists in Paris.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c9847479zljo,"– Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has said he hopes the US will ""stand strong"" in the face of Russian demands to lift sanctions as a condition for a ceasefire in the Black Sea. Moscow said a maritime truce announced on Tuesday to allow safe passage for commercial vessels would only begin once Western restrictions on Russia's food and fertiliser trade had been lifted.Asked by the BBC if the US would resist Russian pressure, he said: ""I hope so. God bless, they will. But we'll see."" The White House said on Tuesday that Russian and Ukrainian delegations had agreed to a ceasefire in the Black Sea after three days of separate talks with American officials in Saudi Arabia.But hours later, the Kremlin released its own statement including a list of conditions.Its demands include revoking Western sanctions on financial institutions involved in the agricultural trade and restoring their access to the Swift international payment system - a network that facilitates secure financial messaging.Trump said the US government was ""looking at"" Moscow's request for the restrictions to be lifted, but the EU said on Wednesday it would not consider removing sanctions before the ""unconditional"" withdrawal of Russian troops from Ukraine's internationally recognized territory.Zelensky said he was ""very grateful"" for bipartisan support from the US, but said he feared some were ""under the influence of Russian narratives.""I don't know - it's difficult for me to say.He said his goal was instead to defend Ukraine and to see his children ""walk along their streets without hiding.""",Positive
"China's dream of becoming a football superpower lies in tatters China has failed to qualify for the last five World Cups - and once again, their chances look unlikely.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ce8vp2e7p64o,"– China's national football team hit its lowest ebb. With a minute left on the clock and trailing Japan 6-0, Chinese defenders were likely wishing for the sweet relief of the final whistle.But Japan's Takefusa Kubo was not feeling charitable.The ball rocketed into the roof of the net, and the man known as ""Japanese Messi"" condemned China to their worst-ever defeat in a World Cup qualifier.The 7-0 spanking in September - described as ""rock-bottom"" by a Shanghai-based newspaper—followed a year-long line of humiliating defeats which included losses to Oman, Uzbekistan and Hong Kong.But worse was to come.A week later dozens of players, coaches and administrators were arrested for gambling, match-fixing and bribery as part of a two-year probe into corruption in the domestic game.It wasn't long ago that China had dreamed of becoming a footballing superpower. The world's largest population, a thriving economy and a determined Communist Party led by an avid football fan, President Xi Jinping.But football, it seems, could not thrive in the grip of the Communist Party.A key government report in 2015 noted that The Chinese Football Association (CFA) must have ""legal autonomy,"" and should be ""independent"" of the General Administration of Sport (GAS).Even Xi admitted that if China wanted to succeed, then the Party would have to do what it seldom does: let go.The statistics bear this out: England's 1.3 million registered players dwarf China's fewer-than-than-100,000 footballers.",Positive
