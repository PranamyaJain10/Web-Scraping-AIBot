"Thousands remember George Floyd on fifth anniversary of death As the cities where Floyd grew up and died hold commemorations,  the US ""reckoning"" with racism seems to be fading.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cgmjzyp0kwzo,"– Five years after George Floyd was killed by police, with special gatherings in the city where he grew up and the one where he died.The murder of Floyd, a black man, in Minneapolis by police officer Derek Chauvin led to nationwide protests against racism and police brutality.On Sunday, Floyd's family gathered in their hometown of Houston near Floyd's gravesite for a service led by the Rev Al Sharpton, while Minneapolis held several commemorations.What many hailed as a national ""reckoning"" with racism after Floyd's death, though, seems to be fading as President Donald Trump starts to roll back police reforms in Minneapolis and other cities.Floyd was murdered in 2020 during a police arrest in Minneapolis when Chauvin, a white police officer, stood on his neck for more than nine minutes.The killing - captured on a bystander's phone camera - sparked global outrage and a wave of demonstrations against racial injustice and police use of force.Chauvin has been serving a 22-year prison sentence after he was convicted of murdering the 46-year-old.In a post on X, Rev Sharpton said Floyd's death had ""forced a long overdue reckoning with systemic racism and galvanized millions to take to the streets in protest.""What many hailed as a national ""reckoning"" with racism after Floyd's death, though, seems to be fading as President Donald Trump starts to roll back police reforms in Minneapolis and other cities.",Negative
Young US men are joining Russian churches promising 'absurd levels of manliness' A religion with traditions dating back centuries is attracting young American men.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c30q5l8d4lro,"– ""When my wife and I converted 20 years ago we used to call Orthodoxy the best-kept secret, because people just didn't know what it was,"" he says. ""But in the past year-and-a-half our congregation has tripled in size."" During the Sunday liturgy at Father Moses's church, I am struck by the number of men in their twenties and praying and crossing themselves at the back of the nave, and how this religion—with traditions dating back to the 4th century AD—seems to attract young men uneasy with life in modern America.""We are told that's a very toxic relationship nowadays,"" Theodore says. Father John Whiteford, an archpriest in the ROCOR from Spring, north of Houston, says home-schooling ensures a religious education and is ""a way of protecting your children"", while avoiding any talk about ""transgenderism, or the 57 genders of the month or whatever.""Show me one saint in the history of the Church who ever blessed any kind of birth control,"" Father Moses says.",Positive
'It's not fair': Other refugees in limbo as US welcomes white South Africans Refugees from other nations ask why the White House has made an exception for white South Africans.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/czellw10ejdo,"– A man slept outside in a car park overnight in Kenya with his wife and infant son in January, consumed by confusion and disbelief.The family, refugees from the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), had been expecting a flight to the US for resettlement in just hours' time.But after US President Donald Trump suspended the US refugee program just two days before the family's scheduled departure, the man was told their flight to America was abruptly cancelled—less than 24 hours before take-off.""I didn't have anywhere else to go,"" the man, who asked to go by the name of Pacito to protect his identity, told the BBC.Trump's move signaled a major change in the approach that was followed by successive US leaders.Under former President Joe Biden, over 100,000 refugees came to the US in 2024 - the highest annual figure in nearly three decades.The effort has also included an ambitious deportation program under which people have been deported to a notorious mega-prison in El Salvador against a judge's orders, as well as revoking visas from over a thousand university students, and offering illegal immigrants a sum of $1,000 each to ""self-deport.""The situation has left Pacito feeling stuck.Since he has sold all of the equipment that he needed to work in his field of music production, for the past few months he has struggled to find odd jobs to earn money for his family.The moves appear in stark contrast to the White House's decision to fast-track the arrival of white South Africa's white population.Trump signed an executive order in February that opened the refugee pathway exclusively to Afrikaners—white South Africans who he claimed were victims of ""racial discrimination.""It's not fair,"" Pacito commented.",Negative

I don't know what's wrong with him. What the hell happened to him?"" Trump declined to give any details about what his response would be.Until then, the only reaction to the Russian barrage from senior US officials came from Keith Kellogg, Trump's special envoy for Ukraine.",Negative

The Supreme Court is poised to rule on the cases of two former City traders jailed for rigging interest rates, amid concerns raised by senior politicians that there may have been a series of miscarriages of justice.If the traders are successful in their application—which is opposed by the Serious Fraud Office (SFO)—it could lead to the quashing of all remaining convictions secured in nine criminal trials.The Supreme Court's now being asked to decide if judges were wrong to tell juries their conduct was unlawful.Hayes and Palombo were among 37 City traders prosecuted for ""manipulating"" the interest rate benchmarks Libor and Euribor, which track the cost of borrowing cash between the banks and are used to set the interest rates on millions of mortgages and commercial loans.As they served time, evidence emerged that central bankers and government officials across the world, including a top adviser at 10 Downing Street at the time, had pressured banks such as theirs to engage in very similar conduct to what they were jailed for—but on a much greater scale.Hayes and Palombo were among 37 City traders prosecuted for ""manipulating"" the interest rate benchmarks Libor and Euribor, which track the cost of borrowing cash between the banks and are used to set the interest rates on millions of mortgages and commercial loans.The evidence against Hayes and Palombo were messages they had sent to the cash traders asking them to select a 'high' or 'low' rate from that range, depending on what might benefit their banks' trades.Hayes and Palombo were among 37 City traders prosecuted for ""manipulating"" interest rates in criminal trials on both sides of the Atlantic from 2015 to 2019.",Positive
