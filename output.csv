Trump criticises Zelensky as Ukraine refuses Russian control of Crimea The Ukrainian president has consistently rejected the suggestion that his country give up its claim to the Crimean Peninsula.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c78jx68d922o,"– US President Donald Trump has accused Volodymyr Zelensky of harming peace negotiations, after the Ukrainian president said Kyiv would not recognize Russian control of Crimea. Writing on Truth Social, Trump claimed a deal to end the war was ""very close"", but that Zelensky's refusal to accept US terms ""will do nothing but prolong"" the conflict.Earlier, US Vice-President JD Vance laid out the US vision for a deal, saying it would ""freeze the territorial lines... close to where they are today.""Ukraine has long said it will not give up Crimea, a southern peninsula illegally annexed by Russia in 2014.Vance warned on Wednesday that the US would ""walk away"" from its deal-making role if Russia and Ukraine do not come to an agreement - echoing comments last week by Trump and US Secretary of State Marco Rubio.Trump said on Wednesday in the Oval Office that he found it easier to deal with Russia compared to Ukraine.He left open the idea of meeting with the Ukrainian leader when world leaders gather for Pope Francis' funeral on Saturday.US officials also pulled out of a London meeting to focus on talks in Moscow, as the pace of diplomacy to end the war quickens.",Positive
US intensifying bid to end Ukraine war - but chances of success remain unclear Negotiations are gathering pace but the proposals being put forward by Trump's team still have major gaps.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c70znjwezd4o,"– The pace of diplomatic efforts to end the war in Ukraine is quickening.Talks are taking place in London between officials from the UK, Germany, France, Ukraine and the United States.Donald Trump's special envoy Steve Witkoff is heading to Moscow for his fourth meeting with President Putin.There is little clarity about where these efforts are heading or whether they will be successful.Not so long ago the American plan for ending the fighting in Ukraine was clear.There seems to be a framework along the following lines: Russia would halt its invasion along current lines, and would give up its ambition to control the remaining parts of the four regions of eastern Ukraine it has yet to occupy, namely Luhansk, Donetsk, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson.In return, the US would accept the four occupied territories de facto as Russian controlled.It would also recognize Crimea—which was annexed illegally by Russia in 2014—as de jure Russian territory.President Zelensky has already made it clear Ukraine would never concede that Crimea is Russian sovereignty.The European powers have made clear they would not accept Russian sovereignty over Crimea, something that would breach post-war international legal norms that borders should not be changed by military force.There is also uncertainty about what economic sanctions against Russia would be lifted and when, and under what circumstances.Ukraine still wants an immediate conditional ceasefire and then talks.President Putin said ""the root causes"" of the war had to be addressed.",Positive
"BBC reporter asks Trump how Canada's election could influence tariffs The president avoided predicting who could win the election, but said the US does not need Canada's cars, energy or lumber.",https://www.bbc.com/news/videos/ce3vgpq80nzo,"– President Trump's plan to halt higher-band taxes came as a surprise on Wednesday, but was it part of a plan?

Severe weather hit parts of the US as forecasters warned that swollen rivers pose a danger even after the rain stops.' Dozens of destructive tornadoes touched down in the Midwest and South on Wednesday night killing at least six people.

The church Pope Francis kept returning to - and chose as his final resting place The Pope would visit Santa Maria Maggiore whenever he returned to Rome and chose it as the site of his grave.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cgrgzl0vyqpo,"– When Pope Francis came back to Rome after a trip abroad, he made sure to pay a visit to the church of Santa Maria Maggiore.It was a fitting choice: Francis was particularly devoted to the Virgin Mary, and Santa Maria Maggiore was the first church to be dedicated to her when it was built in the 4th Century.On Saturday, it will also become Francis' final resting place.The basilica also hosts what is said to be a relic of Jesus's crib and an icon of Mary, to whom Pope Francis would pray to asking for protection before a journey.Santa Maria Maggiore's senior priest, the Lithuanian Rolandas Makrickas, gave Italian newspaper Il Messaggero his account of how the Pope's decision to be laid to rest there came about.He said: ""In May 2022... I asked him if he wasn't by any chance thinking about being buried in [the basilica], given how often he came."" Francis smiled and said that Popes are buried in St Peter's—and that was that.""A week later he called me and said, 'the Virgin Mary has told me to prepare my tomb'.Then he simply told me, 'find a place for it, because I want to be buried in this basilica and you've been a bit of a prophet.'""",Positive
"Weinstein used 'unfettered power' to sexually abuse women, rape retrial hears Weinstein, who has pleaded not guilty to sex crimes, returns to court after a conviction was overturned.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvgn4y4pzq7o,"– Attorneys delivered opening statements on Wednesday in the New York retrial of Harvey Weinstein, with prosecutors accusing the disgraced film producer of using his immense power in Hollywood to sexually harass and abuse three women. ""The defendant wanted their bodies, and the more they resisted, the more forceful he got,"" Assistant District Attorney Shannon Lucey told jurors on Wednesday. Weinstein is accused of sexually abusing a former television production assistant, an aspiring actress, and a model. The retrial in New York is centered on two women who brought allegations against Weinstein for his 2020 trial, actress Jessica Mann and former TV production assistant Miriam Haley.This time, the trial also includes allegations from former Polish model and actress Kaja Sokola, who has accused Weinstein of assaulting her when she was 16. Attorney Arthur Aidala told the jury the prosecution case would ""fall flat on its face"" after they heard all the evidence.""They're going to ask you to make sense of things that just don't make sense,"" he said.A court of appeals overturned Weinstein's previous conviction for sex crimes in New York last April, before he was indicted on new sexual assault charges in the state in September.Last week, 12 jurors - seven women and five men - were chosen to weigh Weinstein's fate.",Negative
"Deadly Kashmir attack risks India military escalation against Pakistan India will respond but it's not clear how - or at what cost, experts say.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwynx7kgyqvo,"– Tuesday's bloodshed in Pahalgam—where at least 26 tourists were killed in a hail of gunfire—marks the deadliest militant attack in Kashmir since 2019.The victims weren't soldiers or officials, but civilians on holiday in one of India's most picturesque valleys.Michael Kugelman, a foreign policy analyst, believes that the combination of high fatality levels and the targeting of Indian civilians in the latest attack ""suggests a strong possibility of an Indian military response against Pakistan, if Delhi determines or merely assumes any level of Pakistani complicity.""The question, analysts say, is not whether there will be a military response—but when, and how calibrated it will be, and at what cost.""We are likely to see a strong response—one that signals resolve to both domestic audiences and actors in Pakistan. Since 2016 and especially after 2019, the threshold for retaliation has been set at cross-border or air strikes,"" military historian Srinath Raghavan told the BBC.""It'll be hard for the government to act below that now.The risk, as always, is miscalculation—on both sides.""Mr Raghavan is alluding to two previous major retaliations by India in 2016 and 2019.",Positive
"Five cards China holds in a trade war with the US From rare earths to billions in US debt, here's what China has in its arsenal - and how strong they are.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0kxe1m1y26o,"– President Xi Jinping may be worried but, so far, Beijing has struck a defiant and confident tone.One official assured the country: ""The sky will not fall."" China has always been known as the world's factory - but it has been pouring billions into becoming a far more advanced one.Under Xi, it has been in a race with the US for tech dominance.China also has a higher threshold for pain as an authoritarian regime, as it is far less worried about short-term public opinion.Still, unrest is a concern, especially because there is already discontent over an ongoing property crisis and job losses.The economic uncertainty over tariffs is yet another blow for young people who have only ever known a rising China.China is still fumbling with the keys because Chinese people are not spending enough.But with a range of incentives, from subsidies for household appliances to'silver trains' for traveling retirees, that could change.China also has a higher threshold for pain as an authoritarian regime, as it is far less worried about short-term public opinion.President Xi Jinping may be worried but, so far, Beijing has struck a defiant and confident tone.Ever since Trump tariffs hit Chinese solar panels back in 2018, Beijing sped up its plans for a future beyond a US-led world order.It has pumped billions into a contentious trade and infrastructure program, better known as the Belt and Road initiative, to shore up ties with the so-called Global South.The expansion of trade with South East Asia, Latin America and Africa comes as China tries to wean itself off the US.American farmers once supplied 40% of China's soybean imports—that figure now hovers at 20%.",Negative
Trump's threats unite Canadians - even many who want independence A surge in Canadian patriotism has even hit French-speaking Quebec - and that could help the Liberals retain power.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c98576z8ln8o,"– The issue of independence from Canada has long simmered. But faced with US tariffs and President Trump's comments about making Canada the 51st US state, many voters are now seeking unity.Suzanne Dumont knows who she will vote for in Canada's election, though it's a decision made ""not from my heart, it's from my head.""The 70-year-old from Quebec City considers herself a sovereigntist, but hopes when Canadians go to the polls on Monday they'll elect a majority government to take on Trump.The Bloc Québécois, a federal party that supports independence and only runs candidates in the predominantly French-speaking province, can't deliver on that, she says.Sébastien Dallaire, a pollster with Léger, puts it this way: ""It's hard to say now is the time to talk about Quebec sovereignty, or now is the time to do things specifically to defend Quebec, when clearly there's a national crisis and everybody is staring not at Ottawa as the adversary, but as Washington as the clear opponent."" A recent Léger survey suggests that almost 40% of voters for the Bloc believe an independent Quebec would have less influence than Canada as a whole in dealing with the US.Quebec can be a wildcard in general elections, and winning the province—which holds 78 seats of the 343 in the House of Commons—can propel a party to power.The abandonment of smaller parties—like the Bloc, the left-leaning New Democrats or the Green Party—is a trend seen nationwide as Canadians rally around either the Liberals or the Conservatives in the face of a new threat from their neighbor.",Positive
China sends Boeing planes back to US over tariffs,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3evw059x04o,"– China has sent back planes it ordered from the US in its latest retaliation over Trump tariffs, the boss of aircraft maker Boeing has said.Kelly Ortberg said two planes had already been returned and another would follow after trade tensions between the two countries escalated.Boeing's chief executive told CNBC that 50 more planes were due to go to China this year but their customers had indicated they will not take delivery of them.The US put 145% tariffs on imports from China and it hit back with a 125% tax on US products.Mr Ortberg said China ""have in fact stopped taking delivery of aircraft because of tariff environment.""Mr Ortberg said Boeing was assessing options to re-market 41 of the already built planes to other customers as there was high demand from other airlines.He said there were nine planes not yet in Boeing's production system and he wanted to ""understand their intentions and if necessary we can assign to other customers.""He added Boeing was ""not going continue to build aircraft for customers who will not take them.""Mr Ortberg told an investor call ""there is not a day that goes by that we're not engaged with either cabinet secretaries or either POTUS himself (President Trump) regarding the trade war between China and the USA.""He added he was ""very hopeful we'll get to some negotiations.""On Wednesday, America's Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told the International Monetary Fund (IMF) conference there was an opportunity for a ""big deal"" between the US and China on trade.Asked about an upcoming meeting between the countries, Bessent said it would be an ""incredible opportunity to strike an agreement, if China was ""serious"" on making its economy less dependent on manufacturing exports.Mr Ortberg also told investors others in the Boeing supply chain were now exposed to tariffs - mainly in Japan and Italy where universal tariffs of 10% are being implemented.",Positive
Flintoff 'thought he had died' in Top Gear crash,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cdxgzy8wy72o,"– Andrew Flintoff has given his first account of the car crash he was in while filming Top Gear, saying he thought he ""was dead"" in the immediate aftermath.The England cricketer-turned-TV presenter sustained serious facial and rib injuries when the three-wheeler car he was driving for the BBC motoring program rolled over in 2022.Speaking in a new Disney+ documentary, 'Freddie' Flintoff said that despite the trauma, he ""remembers everything about it.""I thought I was dead, because I was conscious but I couldn't see anything.I was thinking, is that it? Is that it? You know what I mean? Just black for the rest of my days?""My hat came over my eyes - so I pulled my hat up and I thought, no I'm not [dead], I'm on the Top Gear track, this is not heaven.""Flintoff then looked down to see blood, and said his ""biggest fear"" was that he no longer had a face left.He recalled being in ""agony"" for between half an hour and 40 minutes until an air ambulance arrived and he was taken to hospital.The incident took place on 13 December 2022 at Top Gear's test track at Dunsfold Park Aerodrome in Surrey.Flintoff previously said he is ""loving"" his return to the sport coaching England Lions - the development squad underneath England Men's cricket team.",Negative
