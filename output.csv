You don't need to illustrate it - Vik!"" read one hand-made banner. ""I'm so bored of Fascism,"" read another. While the LGBT community with its vivid paraphernalia made up the core of the march, this year's Pride turned into a celebration of human rights and solidarity.""We don't exactly look as though we were banned!"" a beaming Budapest mayor, Gergely Karacsony, told the crowd, in a speech in front of the Budapest Technical University.A city hall starved of funds and in constant struggle with the central government dared to host an event the government tried to ban, and won - for now at least.""In fact, we look like we're peacefully and freely performing a big, fat show to a puffed-up and hateful power. The police justified a ban on Saturday's march on the grounds children might witness it.Prime Minister Viktor Orban's Fidesz party in parliament, subordinating the freedom of assembly to a 2021 Child Protection law that equated homosexuality with paedophilia, and therefore banned the portrayal or promotion of homosexuality in places where children might see it.",Positive
"Charli, Neil Young and Scissor Sisters give Glastonbury goosebumps With several headliners competing for attention, Saturday was Glastonbury's most compelling night.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cj0m9r35142o,"– Saturday was a night of four headliners at Glastonbury, with fans facing the cruel choice between pop queen Charli XCX, rock legend Neil Young, disco scamps Scissor Sisters and Doechii—rap's hottest new voice.Young, topping the bill on the Pyramid Stage, also delivered an all-time hits set, with ragged, jagged versions of hits like Cinnamon Girl and Like a Hurricane.Doechii, who only played for 45 minutes, still managed to mark herself out as a future headliner; while Scissor Sisters brought out actual Gandalf Sir Ian McKellen to perform Invisible Light.Neil Young's set was a very different, but equally gnarly, cunning.The rocker walked on stage alone, hunched over with his face obscured by a corduroy cap, to play a hushed acoustic version of the classic Sugar Mountain.But that was a cunning misdirect.Doechii's rise over the past year has been nothing short of phenomenal and, while fans await her debut album, this slick, bespoke Glastonbury performance felt like a lesson in the history of hip-hop.",Positive
