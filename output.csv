"Trump says he is 'not happy' with deadly Russian strikes on Kyiv The overnight strikes killed at least eight people and injured 77 more,  local officials have said.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/crld4gkk428o,"– US President Donald Trump has said he is ""not happy"" with deadly Russian strikes on Kyiv and that President Vladimir Putin should ""stop""—but has not said if further action might taken against Russia.Overnight into Thursday, the attacks on the Ukrainian capital killed at least 12 people and injured dozens of others.The US president said he is ""putting a lot of pressure"" on both sides to end the war in Ukraine, following the deadliest attacks Kyiv has seen since last July.It is the latest road bump in efforts to advance a peace deal between the two countries - something the US president said he would be able to quickly do as part of his election campaign last year.In rare criticism of Russian President Vladimir Putin, Trump wrote in a post on Truth Social: ""Not necessary, and very bad timing. Vladimir, STOP!"" The attack has come at a time of growing pressure on Ukraine and President Volodymyr Zelensky to accept Russian occupation of its territory as part of a peace deal.President Zelensky's visit to South Africa, during which he met President Cyril Ramaphosa, signaled a dramatic improvement in the once-strained relations between the two nations.Ramaphosa said during a news briefing alongside Zelensky that he was deeply concerned about the ongoing war in Ukraine.When asked by reporters at the White House this week about whether the administration was looking to recognize Russia's sovereignty over Crimea, Trump said he just wanted to see the war end.President Volodymyr Zelensky responded to the attacks during a visit to South Africa, saying he felt the US could be more forceful with Russia to secure a ceasefire.",Negative
Crimea is key to Trump's peace plan. Here's why Zelensky can't give it up Ukraine's leader has ruled out recognising Russian control of the peninsula as part of a Trump peace plan.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cm2x58m46e1o,"– Vladimir Putin initially denied having anything to do with Russia's capture of Crimea in February 2014, when mysterious masked commandos in unidentified green uniforms seized the local parliament and fanned out across the peninsula.Those ""little green men"" marked the start of Russia's war on Ukraine, which culminated in the 2022 full-scale invasion.The future of Crimea is now at the center of President Donald Trump's peace plan and has prompted Ukraine's Volodymyr Zelensky to rule out recognizing Russian control of the peninsula.The exact terms of his plan have not been published, but reports suggest it would include the US recognizing Crimea as a legal part of Russia - de jure in Latin.For Trump, Ukraine's southern peninsula was ""lost years ago"" and ""is not even a part of discussion"" in peace talks.But for Zelensky to renounce Crimea as an indivisible part of Ukraine would be unconscionable.Constitutions can be changed, but not while Ukraine is under martial law.Trump made the point that ""if [Volodymyr Zelensky] wants Crimea, why didn't they fight for it 11 years ago when it was handed over to Russia without a shot being fired?""",Positive
