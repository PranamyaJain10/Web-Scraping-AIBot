"'Diddy' denied bail after being cleared of most serious charges Combs will remain behind bars because of his history of violence, the judge said, setting sentencing for October.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cjd2e310k25o,"– A judge has denied bail to Sean ""Diddy"" Combs after a jury convicted the hip-hop mogul of transportation to engage in prostitution, but acquitted him of the most serious charges: racketeering and sex trafficking.Lawyers for the recording artist had argued he posed no flight risk, pointing out his jet is being chartered in Hawaii.But Judge Arun Subramanian cited Combs' history of violence as he ruled the rapper must remain behind bars until sentencing later this year when he faces up to 20 years in prison.In the nearly two-month federal trial in New York City, prosecutors accused Combs of using his celebrity status and business empire to run a criminal enterprise to sex traffic women.Sex trafficking and racketeering both carry a maximum sentence of life in prison.As Combs learned the verdict, he got on his knees, put his face into his chair and appeared to be praying.The verdict comes a day after jurors told the court they had reached a decision on the sex-trafficking and transportation to engage in prostitution charges against Combs, but were unable to decide on the racketeering count.The government relied on testimony from Ms Ventura, who took the witness stand while eight-months pregnant, telling the court that Combs had pressured her into sex acts and threatened to release tapes of the freak-offs if she disobeyed.The rapper had acknowledged domestic violence, but denied any non-consensual sexual encounters or a larger racketeering scheme.The mood in court was emotional after jurors announced they had acquitted Combs of the most serious charges:",Negative

Now, staff were being called in to clean up.""PD said he's going to need emergency clean up at hotel,"" his chief of staff texts after another of these events.We have changed Ethan's name because, like many former staff members, he still works in the high-net-worth hospitality industry and fears speaking out about Combs will hurt his career.Staff say he was intense, demanding and volatile, with some attributing his unpredictability to a lifestyle of drug-fuelled parties.The staff members have also given detailed accounts of what it was like to work on the multi-millionaire music mogul's glamorous yacht rentals and inside his sprawling estates across the US - in the Hamptons, Beverly Hills and on Star Island in Miami.Their experiences span the past five to 10 years, a period that was under scrutiny during Combs' criminal trial in New York.At the trial's conclusion on Wednesday, the 55-year-old was cleared of the most serious charges— racketeering, and two counts of sex trafficking related to ex-partner Casandra Ventura and another woman referred to as ""Jane.""Staff say he was intense, demanding and volatile, with some attributing his unpredictability to a lifestyle of drug-fuelled parties.In another exchange seen by the BBC, Khorram texted him to warn a bag needs to be prepared for a Wild King Night in two hours.",Negative

During a hearing on Wednesday, Judge Steven Hippler read the details of the agreement, including that Kohberger waived his right to appeal or seek leniency.The plea deal has divided the families of the victims.Outside court, the father of Kaylee Goncalves, Steve, said he felt ""pretty let down.""The family wanted a full confession, including details about the location of the murder weapon and confirmation the defendant acted alone.However, Madison Mogen's mother and stepfather said outside court they supported the plea agreement.Kohberger, who was a student at nearby Washington State University, was charged in January 2023.It's not believed he knew the victims personally.Kohberger was arrested at his Pennsylvania family home weeks following the stabbings, after investigators said they found DNA evidence on a ""leather knife sheath"" at the crime scene.During the hearing, prosecuting attorney Bill Thompson told the court Kohberger had planned the attack, buying the knife online around eight months before the murders.The two others in the house, Bethany Funke and Dylan Mortensen, survived.Kohberger had previously pleaded not guilty.Idaho is one of 27 US states that allows for capital punishment, but there have been no executions since 2012.",Negative
"Ancient Egyptian history may be rewritten by DNA bone test A DNA bone test on a man who lived 4,500 years ago sheds new light on the rise of Ancient Egypt.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1dnnyz0z6do,"– A DNA bone test on a man who lived 4,500 years ago in the Nile Valley has shed new light on the rise of the Ancient Egyptian civilization.An analysis of his skeleton shows he was 60 years old and possibly worked as a potter, but also that a fifth of his DNA came from ancestors living 1,500km away in the other great civilization of the time, in Mesopotamia or modern day Iraq.It is the first biological evidence of links between the two and could help explain how Egypt was transformed from a disparate collection of farming communities to one of the mightiest civilisations on Earth.The findings lend new weight to the view that writing and agriculture arose through the exchange of people and ideas between these two ancient worlds.The skeleton was excavated in 1902 and donated to World Museum Liverpool, where it then survived bombings during the Blitz that destroyed most of the human remains in their collection.The bone structure indicated that the man was between 45 and 65 years old, though evidence of arthritis pointed to the upper end of the scale.The lead researcher, Prof Pontus Skoglund at the Francis Crick Institute in London, told BBC News that being able to extract and read DNA from ancient bones could shed new light on events and individuals from the past, allowing black and white historical facts to burst into life with technicolour details.",Positive
"'Be careful, they are watching you': Tibet is silent as Dalai Lama turns 90 The BBC speaks to Tibetans in Aba, which has long been at the heart of resistance to Chinese rule.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5y772jlpgzo,"– The question of Tibet's future has taken on urgency with the Dalai Lama turning 90 this week.He announced the much-anticipated succession plan on Wednesday, reaffirming what he has said before: the next Dalai Lama would be chosen after his death.Tibetans everywhere have reacted - with relief, doubt or anxiety - but not those in the Dalai Lama's homeland, where even the whisper of his name is forbidden.Beijing has spoken loud and clear: the next reincarnation of the Dalai Lama will be in China, and approved by the Chinese Communist Party.He gave no details, and our conversations were brief to avoid detection.But millions of Tibetans live outside of TAR - and consider the rest as part of their homeland.Aba has long played a crucial role. Protests erupted here during the Tibet-wide uprising of 2008 after, by some accounts, a monk held up a photo of the Dalai Lama inside the Kirti monastery.It eventually escalated into a riot and Chinese troops opened fire.Aba has long played a crucial role.Beijing has cracked down harder since, making it nearly impossible to determine what is happening in Tibet or Tibetan areas.The information that does emerge comes from those who have fled abroad, or the government-in-exile in India.",Positive
"Here are the sticking points as House holdouts stall Trump's budget bill Backbenchers in the president's party have a number of objections, from welfare cuts to national debt.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c20rrxjnx4lo,"– President Trump's massive tax and spending budget bill has returned to the US House of Representatives—as the clock ticks down to the president's 4 July deadline for lawmakers to present him with a final version that can be signed into law. The bill narrowly cleared the Senate, or upper chamber of Congress, on Tuesday. It has so far proven equally tricky for Trump's allies to pass the bill through the House, where Speaker Mike Johnson's hopes of holding a vote on Wednesday appear to be thinning out. Members of Congress had emptied from the House floor by the afternoon, after it became clear there weren't even enough votes for the bill to pass the rule that allows the legislation to be brought to the floor, typically an easy procedural task.The House, or lower chamber, approved an earlier version of the bill in May with a margin of just one vote, and this bill, with new amendments that have frustrated some Republicans, must now be reconciled with the Senate version. Trump has been very involved in attempting to persuade the holdouts and held several meetings at the White House on Wednesday in hopes of winning them over.",Positive

Mass evacuations as wildfire rages in Greek island of Crete,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cd0vdkry307o,"– A major wildfire in Greece continues to burn out of control in eastern Crete, after breaking out on Wednesday afternoon in rugged forested terrain near the municipality of Ierapetra.Fanned by gale-force winds reaching up to eight on the Beaufort scale, the flames have spread rapidly southward, threatening homes, tourist accommodation, and critical infrastructure, including a fuel station.Thick smoke engulfed the wider area, reducing visibility to near zero in places.The operation is underway with the support of the fire service, police, and local volunteers.So far, approximately 1,500 people have been evacuated from surrounding settlements and tourist areas and moved to Ierapetra.Some individuals who were cut off by road were reportedly evacuated by boat from local beaches.The fire, believed to have started between Agia Fotia and the village of Skinokapsala, continues to burn through dense, highly flammable forest, with steep terrain, dry conditions, and strong winds making containment extremely difficult.Earlier this week in Turkey more than 50,000 people were evacuated due to wildfires in the western province of Izmir.",Negative
