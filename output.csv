Anthony Zurcher: The promise and peril of Trump's inaugural speech Trump's inaugural speech was a mix of promises – and contradictions – that underlined some of the challenges he faces upon his return.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cj02zmj59r5o,"– Donald Trump, who rode back into power on a wave of voter dissatisfaction with the status quo, promised a new ""golden age"" for America in his inaugural address.The speech was a mix of promises—and contradictions—that underlined some of the opportunities and challenges the new president will face in his second term in office.

He also promised to end government-promoted diversity programs and noted that US official policy would only recognize two genders, male and female.It was the kind of populist, anti-elite rhetoric that has been a staple of Trump's speeches for a decade.Unlike when Trump first began his ascent to the pinnacles of US political power in 2015, however, Trump represents the current emerging establishment as much as any one man.The speech was a mix of promises—and contradictions—that underlined some of the opportunities and challenges the new president will face in his second term in office.",Positive
