"Congress passes Trump's 'big, beautiful bill' cutting taxes and spending The president wins over sparring factions within his own party to get the bill passed after months of wrangling.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cddz3n6vz0go,"– The US Congress has passed Donald Trump's sprawling tax and spending bill in a significant and hard-fought victory for the president and his domestic agenda.After a grueling session on Capitol Hill, the House of Representatives passed the bill by a vote of 218 to 214 on Thursday afternoon.It was approved in the Senate on Tuesday by one vote.The Congressional Budget Office estimates the bill could add $3.3tn (£2.4tn) to federal deficits over the next 10 years and leave millions without health coverage—a forecast that the White House disputes.The legislation makes savings through making cuts to food benefits and health care and rolling back tax breaks for clean energy projects.It also delivers on two of Trump's major campaign promises—making his 2017 tax cuts permanent and lifting taxes on tips, overtime, and Social Security recipients—at a cost of $4.5tn over 10 years.The fate of the so-called 'big, beautiful bill' hung in the balance for much of Wednesday as Republican rebels with concerns about the impact on national debt held firm.The bill's passage on Thursday was delayed by Democratic House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, who delivered the longest speech in the chamber's history.The Congressional Budget Office estimates the bill could add $3.3tn (£2.4tn) to federal deficits over the next 10 years and leave millions without health coverage—a forecast that the White House disputes.",Positive
The curious case of the British jet stuck in India A state-of-the-art F-35B has been stranded at Thiruvananthapuram airport for nearly three weeks.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy8gj2nlnywo,"– A state-of-the-art British fighter jet stuck at an airport in India for nearly three weeks now has sparked curiosity and raised questions about how such a modern aircraft could get stranded for days in a foreign country.The F-35B landed at Thiruvananthapuram airport in the southern state of Kerala on 14 June.The aircraft was diverted there after it ran into bad weather during a sortie in the Indian ocean and was unable to return to HMS Prince of Wales, the Royal Navy's flagship carrier.It landed safely but it has since developed a technical snag and is unable to return to the carrier.

"Trump gets major win - but debate over his mega-bill is just beginning The US president can celebrate the passage of his bill, though the debate over its merits will continue, writes Anthony Zurcher.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clynr0yywdeo,"– Donald Trump has his first major legislative victory of his second presidential term.The ""big, beautiful bill"", as he calls it, is a sprawling package that includes many key pieces of his agenda—delivering on promises he made on the campaign trail.The really big numbers, however, are in the tax cuts in this legislation.Some of these are cuts that were first enacted in Trump's first term, and were set to expire before the bill makes them permanent.The White House contends that the tax cuts will spur economic growth that will generate sufficient new revenue, when taken alongside tariff collections.But outside projections suggest that this legislation will add more than $3tn in new US debt.As critics like Republican Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky have pointed out, the legislation raises the amount of new debt the federal government can issue by $5tn—a step that would not be necessary if the White House truly believed their budget projections.Paul and others like tech multibillionaire Elon Musk have warned that this massive amount of debt will be growing burden on the federal government, as interest payments crowd out other spending and drive up interest rates.Another senator who voted against the legislation, Thom Tillis of North Carolina, had a different warning for Trump and his party.Trump is preparing what should be a celebratory bill signing ceremony on 4 July - American Independence Day - and will tout his ability to govern not just through executive order, but also through enacting new law.But the fight to define the benefits—and consequences—of this bill is just beginning.",Negative
