"Who are the Druze and why is Israel attacking Syria? A fresh wave of deadly sectarian violence has rocked Syria, highlighting the country's fragile security landscape.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c70xyv4z74go,"– Israel has been reaching out to the Druze community near its northern border in a bid to forge alliances with Syria's minorities.On Sunday 13 July, the reported abduction of a merchant from the Druze minority sparked days of deadly clashes between Druze militias and Sunni Bedouin fighters in southern Syria.Later on Tuesday 15 July, Israel intervened militarily, saying its forces were seeking to protect the Druze and to eliminate pro-government forces accused of attacking them in Suweida.The violence is the first in the Druze-majority province of Suweida since fighting in April and May between Druze fighters and Syria's new security forces killed dozens of people.The US Secretary of State Marco Rubio has said the US was ""very concerned"" about the violence and announced on 16 July: ""We have agreed on specific steps that will bring this troubling and horrifying situation to an end tonight.""The deadly unrest, along with the violent Israeli strikes, have re-ignited fears of a security breakdown in Syria, as the country grapples with the fallout from over a decade of civil war, and the recent Islamist-led rebel takeover of Damascus in December 2024. Israel has struck Syria multiple times, with the intention of preventing the new authorities from building its military capacities - viewed as a potential threat to Israeli security.The most recent strikes have primarily acted as a warning and a deterrent against the Syrian army deploying to southern Syria, with Israel seeking to create a demilitarized zone in the area.",Negative
"'Sparring in space' – BBC gains rare access to US base tracking global missile strikes From their base in Colorado, Space Force units track missiles fired anywhere in the world.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy8k2nd7e9no,"– They're called Guardians, not troops. Staring into their screens at a base in the suburbs of Denver, Colorado, they're able to track a missile launch from anywhere in the world - and follow it from its launch site to its likely point of impact.We're the first international journalists to be allowed inside the US Space Force's missile warning and tracking operations room at Buckley Space Force base, a nerve center where Guardians are on alert 24/7.They're surrounded by giant monitors which provide maps and data sent from a constellation of military satellites in space.These Guardians are the first to detect the infra-red heat signature when a missile is launched.The US won't publicly confirm it but it seems likely they might also have given Kyiv a heads up when it was about to come under Russian attack.Buckley Space Force base will form a key part of President Trump's plans for a US missile defense shield, known as the Golden Dome.He has earmarked $175bn (£130bn) for the ambitious program—inspired by Israel's Iron Dome air defense system.Space is increasingly congested and contested.Col Hauser says it will have tens of thousands more in low earth orbit.President Trump launched the force in his first term, describing space as ""the world's newest war-fighting domain.""",Positive

"Trump's Epstein strategy could pit him against loyal supporters In defending how his administration is handling supposed files on Jeffrey Epstein, he says ""some stupid Republicans"" fell for a hoax.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cjrlg94wnq9o,"– President Trump is drawing battle lines on the Epstein issue that divides his own side.It also risks cutting through the foundations on which his political strength is built.Trump's success has been powered by two central messages to his supporters—that he's an outsider who fights against a corrupt establishment and that he tells it like it is.The potential flaw in the president's strategy this time became apparent halfway through his post, however, as he turned to blame his own party and his own supporters for falling for what he said was a leftist scheme.Trump, never one to shy away from wild conspiracy theories or those who embrace them, now finds himself arguing that there is no ""credible"" evidence implicating the rich and powerful in the Epstein case and that those believing otherwise are suckers or fools.His shifting comments—that the Epstein files should be released, that there are no files, that any possible files are hoaxes—also make him seem less like a straight-shooter and more like a man with something to hide.Speaker of the House Mike Johnson, who oversaw those efforts, walked back earlier comments calling for more Epstein files to be disclosed, saying that he was misquoted and that he only wanted the public to see ""credible"" information—the same language Trump has used.An internal Democratic poll obtained by Politico found 58% of respondents believed Trump ""maybe was or definitely was"" involved in a cover-up.Congressional Republicans are backing the president's legislative agenda despite their narrow majorities in key votes this week.",Positive
"Babies made using three people's DNA are born free of hereditary disease The method was pioneered by UK scientists to overcome devastating, sometimes fatal inherited diseases.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn8179z199vo,"– Eight babies have been born in the UK using genetic material from three people to prevent devastating and often fatal conditions, doctors say.The method, pioneered by UK scientists, combines the egg and sperm from a mum and dad with a second egg from a donor woman.The technique has been legal here for a decade but we now have the first proof it is leading to children born free of incurable mitochondrial disease.These conditions are normally passed from mother to child, starving the body of energy. This can cause severe disability and some babies die within days of being born. Couples know they are at risk if previous children, family members or the mother has been affected.Children born through the three-person technique inherit most of their DNA, their genetic blueprint, from their parents, but also get a tiny amount, about 0.1%, from the second woman.The team in Newcastle anticipate there is demand for 20 to 30 babies born through the three-person method each year.It led to four boys and four girls, including one pair of twins, and one ongoing pregnancy.""To see the relief and joy in the faces of the parents of these babies after such a long wait and fear of consequences, it's brilliant to be able to see these babies alive, thriving and developing normally,"" Prof Bobby McFarland, the director of the NHS Highly Specialised Service for Rare Mitochondrial Disorders told the BBC.",Positive
