"Fuel switches cut off before Air India crash that killed 260, preliminary report says In the cockpit voice recording, one of the pilots is heard asking the other why he ""did the cut-off"".",https://www.bbc.com/news/live/cx20p2x9093t,"– A month after Air India Flight 171 crashed into a densely-populated residential area in the Indian city of Ahmedabad in June, killing 260 people, the preliminary report sets out what happened. What we don't know is why. The report itself is careful not to draw any conclusions—and the investigation (which has been criticized by some for its lack of urgency and transparency) is ongoing. It is highly likely the ""human aspect""—the personal circumstances of the flight crew—will form part of that process. Cockpit audio captured one pilot asking the other, ""Why did you do the cut-off?""- referring to the fuel switch that starved the engines. The conversation between the two pilots appears to show that one of them was aware the switches had been moved—though the other denied it. It's still unclear who asked the question—and who answered.",Negative

North Korea's Benidorm-style resort welcomes first Russian tourists Details of how it was built - in a country largely closed to the outside world - are shrouded in secrecy.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwyrk588dlro,"– A new beach resort in North Korea, criticized by human rights groups for the harsh treatment of construction workers, has welcomed its first group of Russian tourists this week.The Wonsan Kalma resort was opened in a grand ceremony last month by North Korea's leader, Kim Jong Un, who hailed it as a ""world-class tourist and cultural destination.""The details of how this resort was built have been shrouded in secrecy in a country largely closed to the outside world.BBC Verify has studied satellite imagery, obtained internal planning documents, and spoken to experts and former North Korean insiders about their concerns over human rights abuses during the development of the site.Kim Jong Un spent much of his youth in Wonsan, and prior to the building of the new resort the town was a popular holiday destination for the country's elite.There's an aquatic park, complete with towering yellow water slides, is set back from the beach.The UN has highlighted a system of forced labor used in North Korea, in particular ""shock brigades"" where workers often face harsh conditions, long hours, and inadequate compensation.James Heenan of the UN Human Rights Office in Seoul says ""there are reports that the resort was built using what they call shock brigades.""The BBC reached out to North Korean officials for comment.",Negative
"Trade trumps geopolitics as Australia PM visits China The visit comes as countries around the world navigate the US president's ""America First"" policies.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c7vrjlp5zdvo,"– Australia's leader Anthony Albanese will visit China and meet with President Xi Jinping this weekend as he seeks to strengthen ties with Canberra's largest trading partner. Regional security and trade will take center stage during the prime minister's six-day trip spanning three cities—Beijing, Shanghai, and Chengdu.Analysts say this trip signals a stabilisation of ties between Australia and China, even as Beijing has been trying to extend its military reach across the Pacific to some protest by Australia.Albanese had cited green energy among the areas that Australia and China can ""further engage"" on.The trip marks Albanese's second official visit to China—but the first since his re-election in May.It comes as countries around the world navigate US president Donald Trump's 'America First' policies including tariffs.China accounts for nearly a third of Australia's total trade and ""will remain so for the foreseeable future"", Albanese said.""The relationship in China means jobs in Australia. It's as simple as that,"" he told reporters on Friday.Albanese, whose Labor Party government was re-elected with an increased majority in May, had pledged among other things to create more jobs and bring back manufacturing in Australia.Analysts say this trip signals a stabilization of ties between Australia and China, even as Beijing has been trying to extend its military reach across the Pacific to some protest by Australia.Albanese will continue to criticize Australia's involvement in the Aukus submarine deal with its longstanding allies, the UK and the US, observers tell the BBC, while Canberra will reiterate its commitment to the pact—even as Trump's administration has recently put the agreement under review.",Positive
Flight from London to Cancun lands in US after fight breaks out on board The two passengers involved in the fight did not face criminal charges but all passengers were stranded in Maine overnight.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c98jqve2q7mo,"– A flight traveling from Cancun, Mexico, to London was forced to divert and land in Maine this week after two passengers on board began fighting. The emergency landing around 21:30 EST (01:30GMT) on Tuesday resulted in all 267 passengers on board being forced to spend the night in Bangor, Maine.

"Why cockpit audio deepens the mystery of Air India crash Fuel cut-off switches flipped seconds after takeoff in Air India crash, starving engines and causing power loss.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx2gy78gpnqo,"– Investigators have uncovered a chilling discovery in the preliminary investigation into the Air India Flight 171 crash which killed 260 people in June.Just seconds after takeoff, both the 12-year-old Boeing 787 Dreamliner's fuel-control switches abruptly moved to the ""cut-off"" position, starving the engines of fuel and triggering total power loss. Switching to ""cut-off"" is a move typically done only after landing.The cockpit voice recording captures one pilot asking the other why he ""did the cut-off"", to which the person replies that he didn't. Investigators are probing the wreckage and cockpit recorders to understand what went wrong just after takeoff.The Air India flight climbed to 625 feet in clear weather before losing location data 50 seconds in, per Flightradar24. Saturday's 15-page report offers early insights.The investigation - led by Indian authorities, with experts from Boeing, GE, Air India and Indian regulators, alongside participants from the US National Transportation Safety Board and the UK - also raises a number of questions.It says in December 2018, the US Federal Aviation Administration issued a Special Airworthiness Information Bulletin (SAIB) highlighting that some Boeing 737 fuel control switches were installed with the locking feature disengaged.In short, investigators say what's needed is clear voice identification, a full cockpit transcript with labelled speakers, and a thorough review of all communications from the moment the plane was pushed back from the gate to the time it crashed.",Negative
"Canada's Carney talked tough on Trump - now some say he's backing down Canada has made concessions to win goodwill with the White House. Trump, in return, has threatened steeper tariffs.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvg81518yyyo,"– It's another curveball in the Canada-US trade war—a new missive by US Donald Trump threatening an unexpected 35% tariff on Canadian goods starting next month. It came as the two countries engage in intense trade talks meant to produce a new deal in the coming days, and what the latest tariff threat means for these negotiations is unclear. But Canada's new prime minister, Mark Carney, is beginning to face questions over whether he is able to stand up to Trump and secure the fair deal for Canada he promised.Carney won April's general election vowing to keep his ""elbows up"" in the face of US threats, leaning on a popular ice hockey metaphor used to describe an assertive and confrontational style of play.But Canada's recent concessions to Trump appear to have yielded, to date, little result.Trump threatens 35% tariffs on Canadian goodsCanada will deal with Trump 'on our terms', Carney tells BBCThe latest came in late June, when Canada scrapped a Digital Services Tax (DST) it had planned to impose on big tech companies after Trump threatened to end negotiations over the policy.Many US-based manufacturers also rely on Canadian products like steel and aluminum, which are currently subject to a steep 50% tariff.The good news for Canada is that the new tariff rate will not apply—at least for now—to goods under the US-Mexico-Canada free trade agreement, which covers a vast majority of the cross-border trade.President Trump has also sent similar notes to more than 20 countries as part of his plan to carve out new agreements with America's trade partners.Domestically, Canadians across political stripes remain united against Trump's tariffs.",Positive
"'They were just kids': Mother mourns sons killed in Israeli strike while waiting for aid Two of Iman al-Nouri's five sons were killed outside a clinic in Deir al-Balah on Thursday, while a third was seriously wounded.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy9xgrrq54go,"– The Israeli military's statement on the strike, including its expression of regret, saying that it ""cannot bring those patients, those beneficiaries back alive.""Iman al-Nouri's youngest son, two-year-old Siraj, woke up crying from hunger on Thursday and asked to get some nutritional supplements.Siraj's 14-year-old cousin, Sama, agreed to take him and two of his older brothers - Omar, nine, and Amir, five - to the Altayara health clinic in Deir al-Balah, central Gaza.""The [medical] point was still closed, so they were sitting on the pavement when suddenly we heard the sound of the strike,"" Iman told a local journalist working for the BBC.""I went to [my husband] and said: 'Your children, Hatim! They went to the point.'"" Iman said Siraj's head was bleeding and he had lost an eye—an image that she cannot now get out of her head.""He had fractures in his skull and... according to the doctor, not just bleeding, but [a major haemorrhage] on his brain,"" she added.Israel imposed a total blockade of aid deliveries to Gaza at the start of March and resumed its military offensive against Hamas two weeks later, collapsing a two-month ceasefire.The UN agency for Palestinian refugees (Unrwa) says there are thousands of malnourished children across the territory, with no food and fuel.",Negative

To be clear: detaining and deporting children is not a solution for child labor,"" a statement from the union said.California—particularly Los Angeles County—has been at the center of daily immigration raids since President Trump deployed National Guard troops and US Marines to Los Angeles last month to protect federal immigration agents.",Negative
Intense Med Sea heatwave raises fears for marine life,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4g2v1l7j6yo,"– The Mediterranean is particularly vulnerable because it's a bit like a bathtub, largely surrounded by continents rather than open ocean.That means water cannot escape easily, so its surface heats up quickly in the presence of warm air, sunny skies and light winds—as happened in June.Marine heatwaves are becoming more intense and longer-lasting as humanity continues to release planet-warming gases into our atmosphere, principally by burning coal, oil and gas.What is different this year is that 30C sea temperatures have arrived much earlier, and that means that we can expect the summer to be more intense and longer,"" said Marta Marcos, associate professor at the University of the Balearic Islands in Spain.""I grew up here, so we are used to heatwaves, but this has become more and more common and intense.""We're all very, very surprised at the magnitude of this heatwave,"" added Aida Alvera-Azcrate, an oceanographer at the University of Liege in Belgium.""It's a matter of high concern, but this is something we can expect to be happening again in the future."" Marine heatwaves are becoming more intense and longer-lasting as humanity continues to release planet-warming gases into our atmosphere, principally by burning coal, oil and gas.The heat peaked as June turned to July, after which stronger winds allowed deeper, cooler waters to mix with the warm surface above and bring temperatures down.The heat can also cause what ecologists call ""sub-lethal effects"", where species essentially go into survival mode and don't reproduce.""If we start to see ecological impacts, there will almost certainly be impacts on human societies [including] losses of fisheries,"" warned Dan Smale, senior research fellow at the Marine Biological Association in Plymouth.""I remember four years ago diving in September at the end of summer, we found skeletons of many, many, many, many, many populations,"" said Emma Cebrian, an ecologist at the Center for Advanced Studies of Blanes in Spain.Seaweeds and seagrasses act a bit like the forests of the Mediterranean Sea, home to hundreds of species, home to hundreds of species, as well as locking up planet-warming carbon dioxide.",Positive
