Trump imposes 25% tariffs on Colombia as deported migrant flights blocked It comes after Colombian President Gustavo Petro denied entry to US military planes carrying deported migrants.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cdxny0lnyepo,"– US President Donald Trump has said he will impose 25% tariffs and sanctions on Colombia after its president barred two US military planes carrying deported migrants from landing in the country.Trump said the tariffs ""on all goods"" coming into the US from Colombia would be put in place ""immediately"" and in one week the 25% tariffs would be raised to 50%.Colombian President Gustavo Petro responded by saying he would impose retaliatory tariffs of 25% on the US.Petro earlier on Sunday said he would ""receive our fellow citizens on civilian planes, without treating them like criminals"" and migrants must be returned ""with dignity and respect.""The sanctions and travel bans on the Colombian government and its supporters, and the breakdown in diplomatic relations that signals, are also significant.This is now not just a war of trade, but a war of words.It is no secret that Petro does not like Trump—he has heavily criticized his policies on migration and the environment in the past.",Negative
Co-operate or else: Trump's Colombia face-off is warning to all leaders But there are risks too - coffee prices could rise and nations may be less willing to stop the flow of migrants north.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cglynrxjyl5o,"– Donald Trump has instigated his first international tariff dispute.And the target isn't China, Mexico or Canada—frequent subjects of his ire—it's Colombia, one of America's closest allies in South America.Colombia's offense was refusing to allow two US flights carrying deported migrants to land because they were military, not civilian, transport planes.That appears to have been enough to prompt Trump to drop the hammer.""We will not allow the Colombian government to violate its legal obligations with regard to the acceptance and return of the criminals they forced into the United States,"" Trump posted on his social media site.On top of the 25% tariffs he said he would impose, Trump said the US would introduce a travel ban and ""immediate visa revocations"" on Colombian government officials, as well as its allies and supporters.The US imports about 27% of its coffee from Colombia, according to the US Department of Agriculture, as well as other goods like bananas, crude oil, avocados and flowers.The US' retaliatory measures will no doubt make it harder for Trump's administration to work with Colombia to stop this pattern.President Petro alluded to this in his response to Trump's actions, noting that if talks over managing migration through Darien were suspended, ""illegal activities will increase.""While Trump is unlikely to take threats from Colombia, this is something that should worry a US president who wants to tackle migration.",Negative
"My opponents choose jail and exile, Lukashenko tells BBC On election day, the unchallenged Belarus leader exchanges arguments with the BBC Russia editor.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c23npdrj41do,"– Long-time leader of Belarus Alexander Lukashenko, once dubbed ""Europe's last dictator"", arrived to cast his ballot.Then, while Belarusians were still voting, candidate Lukashenko gave a four-and-a-half hour press conference live on state TV.It was an opportunity to quiz him on the controversial vote which his critics have denounced as ""a sham"".""How can you call this a democratic election, when your main rivals are either in prison or in exile?"" I asked.""Some are in prison, and some are in exile. But you are here!"" said Lukashenko.""Everyone has the right to choose. That is democracy. Some chose prison, others chose exile. We never forced anyone out of the country.""Lukashenko: 'God forbid we should end up like Ukraine' opposition calls election 'a sham' In reality, it was the authorities' brutal crackdown on protesters after the 2020 presidential election that led to Alexander Lukashenko's staunchest opponents either being jailed or driven into political exile. Lukashenko's name was not the only one on the ballot.There were four other candidates.But they came across more like spoilers than serious challengers.""We spoke to some of the other candidates,"" I told Lukashenko.It's a strange election, isn't it, with opponents like this...""Lukashenko: 'God forbid we should end up like Ukraine' opposition calls election 'a sham'",Negative

Inside the race for Greenland's mineral wealth The territory's untapped mineral wealth has caught the eye of both mining firms and Donald Trump.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c9d5jwvw9nlo,"– President Trump has said he thinks the US will gain control of Greenland, underlining a claim on the Arctic island that he has repeated several times recently, on one occasion pointing to ""economic security"" as the reason.Greenland is a self-governing territory that is part of Denmark, but controls its own natural resources.It's endowed with the eighth largest reserves of so-called rare earth elements, which are vital for making everything from mobile phones to batteries and electric motors.Greenland's Minister for Business, Trade, and Raw Materials, Naaja Nathanielsen, says that interest in the territory's minerals has ""absolutely increased within the last five years or so.""He points to China having the world's largest reserves of rare earth metals, while the West wants to secure alternative supplies.""You have a very strong China sitting very heavily on the critical raw materials,"" he says.But there are many more steps before these sites become potential mines.Greenland's politicians hope that mining revenues will reduce reliance on the annual $600m subsidy from Denmark, and help boost independence efforts.Officially Greenland is making more money from tourism.British, Canadian, and Australian mining firms are the biggest foreign license holders, while Americans hold just one.But there are many more steps before these sites become potential mines.",Positive

Israel accused Hamas of breaching the ceasefire deal under which Israeli civilians were to be freed first in exchange for the release of Palestinian prisoners.Since the ceasefire deal came into force, seven hostages and more than 200 prisoners have been released.Under the terms of the ceasefire agreement, Palestinians had been scheduled to be allowed to travel north of the Netzarim Corridor, a seven kilometer (4.3 miles) strip of land controlled by Israel that cuts off north Gaza from the rest of the territory, on Saturday.Images show massive crowds waiting to pass.Israel had asked the mediators for proof from Hamas that Ms Yehud was alive.It appeared that had been given to the Egyptians as early as Saturday evening, the BBC understands.The 42-year-old had traveled from Deir al-Balah in central Gaza, but was displaced from her home in Shejaiya, in the south.Diab Shehbari said he had been at the checkpoint since 20:30 local time (18:30 GMT on Saturday).Hamas will release Ms Yehud and two other hostages on Friday, followed by three more on Saturday,Netanyahu and Qatar, which has mediated the talks, said.Israel will begin to allow Palestinians to move north on Monday, as well as freeing more Palestinian prisoners later in the week.",Positive
"Trump wants neighbours to take in Palestinians to 'clean out' Gaza Palestinians condemn the proposal, and both Jordan and Egypt have rejected Trump's request.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c07kpjyzgllo,"– ""Almost everything is demolished and people are dying there.

Trump did not give further details of the proposal, and the subject was not referenced in the White House's official read-out of the call.It is not clear whether the US president has formally made the request to Egypt, but its foreign ministry has rejected any such effort ""whether through settlement or annexation of land, or by evicting Palestinians from their land through displacement or encouraging the relocation or uprooting of Palestinians from their land, whether temporarily or long-term.""Gaza has been under Israeli occupation since 1967.""You're talking about probably a million and a half people, and we just clean out that whole thing,"" Trump said.",Positive
Survivors return as world remembers Auschwitz 80 years after liberation Fifty survivors - now in their late 80s and 90s - will attend a ceremony marking the camp's liberation.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/czj3mde43k2o,"– They will be joined by heads of state including King Charles and other European royalty, Emmanuel Macron of France and German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier.But it will be the survivors—most in their late 80s and 90s—not the dignitaries, whose voices will be heard during the commemorations at the camp, where 1.1 million people were murdered, most of them Jews.Their message is to tell the world what happened here and ensure that it never happens again.Thirty years ago, there was far less international interest, as renowned writer Elie Wiesel led a large group of fellow survivors and relatives to one of the crematoria blown up by the Nazis before they fled.Although daytime temperatures in recent days have climbed well above freezing and much of the snow has melted, many of the 50 arriving for Monday's commemorations are now too frail to stay in the open for long.Instead, an enormous, heated tent has been erected over the ""Death Gate"", as the entrance to Birkenau is known.The day will begin with survivors and Polish President Andrzej Duda laying a wreath at ""Death Wall"" at the first Auschwitz camp, where thousands of Polish prisoners, Jews and Soviet prisoners of war were shot.",Negative
Lebanon says 22 killed by Israeli forces after withdrawal deadline missed,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/czeprnw4repo,"– Israeli soldiers have killed 22 people and wounded 124 in southern Lebanon, the health ministry says, as the Israeli military remained deployed past a deadline for their withdrawal and Hezbollah's removal from the area.Thousands of residents returned to towns and villages near the border, despite warnings that the region was unsafe.The Israeli military said it had fired ""warning shots in multiple areas"", without specifying if people had been hit, and apprehended several people it claimed posed an ""imminent threat.""Israel said the 60-day ceasefire agreement with Hezbollah had not been fully implemented.It is not clear how many of its soldiers are still in Lebanon or how long they would stay.The passing of the ceasefire deadline is the first major test for the new Lebanese president, army chief Joseph Aoun, who is keen to bring stability to a country exhausted by multiple crises.The withdrawal outlined in the ceasefire was ""conditioned on the Lebanese army deploying in southern Lebanon and fully and effectively enforcing the agreement, while Hezbollah withdraws beyond the Litani"", a river about 20 miles from the unofficial border between Lebanon and Israel known as the Blue Line.""Since the ceasefire agreement has yet to be fully enforced by the Lebanese state, the gradual withdrawal process will continue, in full coordination with the US,"" the statement said.",Positive
