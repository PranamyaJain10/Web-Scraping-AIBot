Can illegal immigrants really vote in the US election? It is illegal for non-citizens to vote in the US election - but Donald Trump has repeatedly claimed illegal immigrants are going to.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5yj98grr5lo,"– Donald Trump and his Republican allies have repeatedly claimed that the Democrats are planning to get illegal immigrants to vote in the US election.BBC Verify has identified more than 100 paid-for ads on Facebook and Instagram posted by Republicans since the start of September focusing on the issue.It is illegal for a non-US citizen to vote in a national election, but studies suggest cases of this actually happening are very rare.The Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 prohibits non-citizens - which includes illegal immigrants - from voting in federal elections.The punishment includes a year in prison, a fine, and possibly deportation.Every state is required to use a common registration form which requires people to confirm they are US citizens, under penalty of perjury for false claims, but does not require documentary proof.“That first step of having to tick a box saying you’re a citizen to register to vote is a huge deterrent for illegal immigrants, as it’s hugely risky to lie,” says Jasleen Singh, a voting expert at the liberal policy think tank Brennan Center for Justice.It's not zero, some people slip through the cracks for various reasons, but it's nowhere near at the level to impact the outcome of an election.""At the polls, there’s a list of eligible voters, and if a non-citizen turns up, they’ll be turned away or told to cast a provisional ballot which will only be accepted if they can provide proof of citizenship,” says Prof Ronald Hayduk, a voting rights expert at San Francisco State University.",Negative
