South Korea in turn said it was ready to respond, and warned that if the safety of its citizens was threatened it would signal the ""end of the North Korean regime.""Then, on Tuesday, the North blew up sections of two roads that connected it to South Korea, making good on an earlier threat.These flare-ups are the latest in a string of exchanges between the two Koreas, which have seen tensions rise to their highest point in years since the North's leader Kim Jong Un declared in January that the South is his regime's number one enemy.North Korea has released blurry images of what it said were the drones flying in the sky, as well as pictures allegedly showing the leaflets, but there is no way of independently verifying their claims.Analysts say the drone incident suggests that North Korea is shoring up internal support by making it appear as though threats against the country are escalating.The most recent spat over alleged drone flights will most likely remain a ""verbal fight"", said Prof Nam Sung-joong, vice governor of Gyeonggi Province, said in a media briefing.",Negative
Canadians who sold purer drugs in bid to stop overdoses challenge charges,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3wp03d97jvo,"– Two Canadians activists who illegally sold untainted hard drugs in an effort to reduce fatal overdoses have launched a legal challenge to federal drug laws.Jeremy Kalicum and Eris Nyx, co-founders of the Drug User Liberation Front (DULF), were charged in June with drug trafficking-related offenses by police in Vancouver.They had made headlines two years ago for offering pure cocaine, meth, and heroin to drug users, saying they wanted to prevent deaths from a supply tainted with other substances.The court challenge argues current drug laws infringe on the right to life and liberty of users by denying them access to a safer supply and discriminate based on disability, in this case severe addiction.Mr Kalicum and Mr Nyx argue Canada has failed to protect drug users by denying them access to 'a regulated, predictable supply of substances.'",Negative
