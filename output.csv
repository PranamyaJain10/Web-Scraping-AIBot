Families return to destruction in southern Lebanon Displaced Lebanese are trying to get to their homes after a ceasefire came into force.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cjr4e51p83do,"– The family of four stood in the middle of the street in front of the pile of twisted metal and broken concrete, struggling to comprehend the devastation they were seeing.The destruction, Mr Marouf said, had been caused by an attack on a residential building nearby.As the pause in the fighting held, residents returned to badly damaged homes.The conflict began last October when Iran-backed Hezbollah began firing into Israel in support of Palestinians in Gaza, and escalated dramatically in September, with intense Israeli air strikes, the killings of several top Hezbollah leaders including long-time chief Hassan Nasrallah, and a ground invasion in the south.Israel's stated goal was to remove the group from the border and allow the return of around 60,000 residents who had been displaced.But now we will reunite with the ones still alive, and wait and see what happens next.""We're unbeatable,"" said Hussein Jashi, a Hezbollah MP, by the rubble of a water pumping station destroyed in an air strike.As the pause in the fighting held, residents returned to badly damaged homes.The destruction, Mr Marouf said, had been caused by an attack on a residential building nearby.As the pause in the fighting held, Israel and Hezbollah will pull out from the south, a traditional Hezbollah stronghold, and the Lebanese military will deploy an additional 5,000 soldiers to the area.But now we will reunite with the ones still alive, and wait and see what happens next.""We're unbeatable,"" said Hussein Jashi, a Hezbollah MP, by the rubble of a water pumping station destroyed in an air strike.",Negative
"Can flights really reach net zero by 2050 - and what will it cost holidaymakers? Governments don’t want to tell people they’re going to have to pay more, argues an expert.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c245e726r79o,"– It is the perfect start to a holiday: your plane ticket is cheap, your cabin baggage is safely stowed, the engines are roaring into life—and the pilot has announced that there’s no need to worry about the environmental impact.This is Jet Zero, a vision where air travel is entirely carbon neutral thanks to new technology and green ventures that offset the environmental impact.The plan was drafted in 2022 when Boris Johnson was prime minister, marking a step towards the government’s legal obligation to reach net zero by 2050.The Labour government has since made a similar pledge, and in addition it wants all domestic flights and UK airport operations to reach zero emissions by 2040.This is no easy feat when you consider the scale of the challenge: one passenger taking an economy-class flight from London to New York generates 309kg of carbon dioxide, which would take roughly a year to absorb via 10 mature trees. Multiply this on the global scale and the aviation industry would need to plant roughly 100 billion mature trees each year to offset its emissions.The Jet Zero Strategy estimates that this, together with other fuel efficiency improvements, could cut emissions by as much as 15% by 2050. Aviation’s CO2 emissions come primarily through jet engines using carbon-rich fossil fuels, which produce CO2 when burned, so there have been attempts to create an alternative type made from renewable biomass and waste resources, known as Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF).The first flight ran between London and Amsterdam in 2008 using fuel derived from a mixture of Brazilian babassu nuts and coconuts.",Positive
Mark Zuckerberg dines with Donald Trump at Mar-a-Lago Relations appear to have improved markedly from Trump's threat earlier this year to throw the Meta boss in jail.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c87x98q8y08o,"– Mark Zuckerberg has visited Donald Trump at his resort in Mar-a-Lago, further evidence of the apparent thawing in their once frosty relations.The president-elect already has a close, high-profile relationship with another of the leading figures in tech, X owner Elon Musk.Historically, though, there has been no such closeness between Trump and Mr Zuckerberg - with Trump barred from Facebook and Instagram after the Capitol riots, and Trump threatening the Meta boss with jail if he interfered in the 2024 presidential election.However, there has recently been evidence those strained relations are improving, culminating in Mr Zuckerberg dining with the president-elect at his Florida mansion.""Mark was grateful for the invitation to join President Trump for dinner and the opportunity to meet with members of his team about the incoming administration,"" a Meta spokesperson told the BBC.""Mark was grateful for the invitation to join President Trump for dinner and the opportunity to meet with members of his team about the incoming administration,"" the statement added.It's an important time for the future of American Innovation,"" the statement added.",Positive
Four US House representatives targeted with bomb threats,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cjw0j6y32pgo,"– Four of Connecticut's five House representatives have been targeted by bomb threats on the US Thanksgiving holiday. Jahana Hayes, Jim Himes, John Larson, and Joe Courtney—all Democrats—said they were notified by police that a threat had been made against them. In each case, no evidence of an explosive was found. Connecticut's fifth house representative, Rosa DeLauro, did not indicate she received such a warning. The news follows similar hoax threats recently made against several of Donald Trump's cabinet nominees and picks for his White House team. On Tuesday and Wednesday, at least nine people chosen by Trump to lead the departments of defense, housing, agriculture and labor, as well as his pick for US ambassador to the United Nations, received warnings.",Negative
Colombian navy intercepts narco-subs taking new route to Australia,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clyrjng13jlo,"– The Colombian navy has intercepted a semi-submersible vessel packed with cocaine in the Pacific Ocean, as part of an operation in which hundreds of arrests have been made.It said the vessel had enough fuel to sail to Australia, on what was believed to be a new smuggling route, and maps indicated that is where it was headed.Smuggling cocaine from South America to Australia is particularly lucrative, as a kilogramme of the illegal drug can fetch up to $240,000 (£190,000) there - six times more than in the US, Colombian security forces said. Officials said the semi-submersible was the third such vessel they had seized in that part of the Pacific.The latest narco-sub was intercepted 1,200 miles southwest of Clipperton Island, an uninhabited French coral atoll in the Pacific.The wood-and-fibre-glass vessel is thought to have sailed from the Colombian port of Tumaco, covering thousands of miles before it was stopped.The chief of naval operations staff for the Colombian Navy, Vice-Admiral Orlando Enrique Grisales, said the three semi-submersibles they had stopped were all capable of sailing from Colombia to Australia without the need to refuel at sea.",Negative
First new asthma attack treatment in 50 years,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cev93777g79o,"– Researchers say they have found the first new treatment for asthma attacks in 50 years.The injection dampens part of the immune system that can go into overdrive in flare-ups of both asthma and a lung condition called chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).Benralizumab is already used in the most severe cases, but the latest research suggests it could be used routinely for around two million attacks in the UK each year.The research team at King's College London said the drug was a ""game-changer"" that could ""revolutionise"" care.The findings stem from the realization that not all asthma or COPD attacks are the same.Instead, different parts of the immune system are over-reacting in different patients.""Now we can see there are different patterns of inflammation, we can be smarter and get the right treatment, to the right patient, at the right time,"" said Prof Mona Bafadhel, from King's.It is estimated that four people with asthma and 85 people with COPD die in the UK every day.Dr Samantha Walker, from the charity Asthma + Lung UK, said the results were ""great news"".""But it's appalling that this is the first new treatment for those suffering from asthma and COPD attacks in 50 years,"" she said.The study will also have to assess cost-effectiveness since monoclonal antibodies, like this therapy, are expensive drugs.But Dr Sanjay Ramakrishnan, from the University of Oxford, said the work so far ""shows massive promise"" and that treatment for COPD was ""stuck in the 20th Century"" despite being one of the leading causes of death worldwide.",Negative
