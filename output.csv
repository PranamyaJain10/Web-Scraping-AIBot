Sinwar's body was found alongside that of Mohammad Sabaneh, the commander of Hamas' Rafah Brigade, the IDF said.It added that ""several items belonging to Sinwar and Sabaneh were located, along with additional intelligence findings that were transferred for further investigation.""The IDF has mounted sieges and attacks on hospitals in Gaza, or ordered their evacuation, leaving the territory's health system on the verge of total collapse.Such attacks have caused widespread international concern, as many hospitals and medical facilities have been put out of action—and the lives of patients and staff put at risk.""This is another example of the cynical use by Hamas, using civilians as human shields, using civilian infrastructure, hospitals, again and again,"" he said. Israel has repeatedly accused Hamas of using hospitals as hiding places for weapons and command centers, which the group denies.",Negative

"Italy citizenship referendum: 'I was born here - but feel rejected' Italy is holding a citizenship referendum and it's proving so divisive that some, including the prime minister, are boycotting it.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c780yk3z2lyo,"– The question of who gets to be Italian is a sensitive one.Large numbers of migrants and refugees arrive in the country each year helped across the Mediterranean from North Africa by smuggling gangs.Meloni's populist government has made a big deal about cutting the number of arrivals.But this referendum is aimed at those who have traveled legally for work to a country with a rapidly shrinking and aging population.The aim is limited: to speed up the process for getting citizenship, not ease the strict criteria.""Knowledge of the Italian language, not having criminal charges, continuous residence et cetera - all the various requirements remain the same,"" explains Carla Taibi of the liberal party More Europe, one of several backers of the referendum.The reform would affect long-term foreign residents already employed in Italy and their families: from those on factory production lines in the north to those caring for pensioners in plush Rome neighborhoods.Giorgia Meloni, the country's hard-right prime minister, has announced she will boycott the vote, declaring the citizenship law already ""excellent"" and ""very open.""The prime minister eventually announced she would turn up at a polling station ""to show respect for the ballot box"" - but refuse to cast a vote.As a non-Italian, Sonny cannot apply for a public sector job, and even struggled to get a driving license.When he was booked for hit reality TV show Fame Island last year, he ended up arriving two weeks late on set in Honduras because he had had had so many problems getting the right paperwork.",Negative

Appearing to confirm that the ship had been boarded, Israel's foreign ministry said the yacht was ""safely making its way to the shores of Israel"" and its passengers were ""expected to return to their home countries.""It is almost 20 months since Israel launched a military campaign in Gaza in response to the unprecedented Hamas-led cross-border attack on Israel on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage.The Madleen is carrying a symbolic quantity of aid, including rice and baby formula, the group said.Citizens of Brazil, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Spain, Sweden and Turkey are onboard.In 2010, Israeli commandos killed 10 people when they boarded Turkish ship Mavi Marmara that was leading an aid flotilla towards Gaza.Israel recently began to allow limited aid into Gaza after a three-month land blockade, prioritizing distribution through the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, which is backed by Israel and the US but widely condemned by humanitarian groups.The UN's human rights chief, Volker Trk, said last week Palestinians were being presented with the ""grimmest of choices: die from starvation or risk being killed while trying to access the meagre food that is being made available.""While Greta and others attempted to stage a media provocation whose sole purpose was to gain publicity - and which included less than a single truckload of aid - more than 1,200 aid trucks have entered Gaza from Israel within the past two weeks, and in addition, the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation has distributed close to 11 million meals directly to civilians in Gaza.""There are ways to deliver aid to the Gaza Strip - they do not involve Instagram selfies,"" the Israeli foreign ministry said.",Negative
