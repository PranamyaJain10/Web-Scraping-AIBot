"White House rejects intelligence assessment that strikes did not destroy Iran nuclear programme Intelligence report is ""a clear attempt to demean"" President Trump, White House says.",https://www.bbc.com/news/live/c20xel1e97gt,"– President Trump's administration has continued to pushback on the report that says the US strikes on Iran did not eliminate its nuclear program. Trump appeared to echo Witkoff's comments by posting a clip of the Fox interview on Truth Social, quoting him as saying: ""We put 12 bunker buster bombs on Fordow. There's no doubt that it breached the canopy...and there's no doubt that it was OBLITERATED. So, the reporting out there that in some way it takes the country to dig out and make repairs is just completely preposterous!"" As we have been reporting, an early Pentagon intelligence assessment of America's attack on Iran on Saturday has cast doubt on the administration's claims that the nuclear program was ""obliterated."" Details of the initial damage assessment from the Pentagon's Defense Intelligence Agency were leaked to the BBC's US partner CBS and other media Trump's special envoy to the Middle East, Steve Witkoff, called the leak ""treasonous"" Meanwhile, a ceasefire between Israel and Iran seems to be holding, with both nations acknowledging it is in place",Negative
Trump takes victory lap but pitfalls remain It's been a rollercoaster ride for Trump but it ends in Europe with high praise for US action in Iran ringing in his ears.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c17wejpw79qo,"– Aboard Air Force One en route to the NATO summit in the Netherlands, Trump shared a personal text message from a somewhat unlikely source.It was sent by NATO boss Mark Rutte who praised the American president for what he had accomplished in using US bombers to attack Iran's nuclear facilities.Trump has had his differences with NATO in the past, as he's called into doubt the alliance's mutual defense agreement and the military contributions made by other member nations.Rutte addressed that, as well, telling Trump he was ""flying into another big success"" at the NATO summit, where member nations had agreed to boost defense spending to 5% of their gross domestic product.""Congratulations and thank you for your decisive action in Iran, "" wrote Rutte in a message the president posted to his Truth Social account.The outlook, however, is more complicated than that.While the administration touts that the US bombing raid ""obliterated"" Iran's nuclear research facilities, US military intelligence officials have told American media that the damage is not as severe as the White House has claimed.The country's nuclear program has probably only been set back by months, according to a preliminary Pentagon intelligence assessment.",Positive
"Australian journalist wins unfair dismissal case over Gaza post The Lebanese-Australian journalist sued Australia's national broadcaster, saying she was unfairly fired.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cj4exrwj8pjo,"– A journalist has won her case against Australia's national broadcaster, with a court ruling she was unfairly fired over a social media post about the war in Gaza.Antoinette Lattouf said the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) fired her without ""proper basis"" or ""due process"" when her five-day contract as a fill-in radio presenter was cut short in December 2023.Hours before, Lattouf shared a post from Human Rights Watch (HRW) that was critical of Israel, a move that the ABC said breached its editorial policy.Lattouf sued for wrongful dismissal, claiming she had been fired due to her political views, her race, and after lobbying from pro-Israel groups.Lattouf sued for wrongful dismissal, claiming she had been fired due to her political views, her race, and after lobbying from pro-Israel groups.The ABC disputed that she was fired, because they had paid her contract in full.Antoinette Lattouf said the ABC's former chair Ita Buttrose had forwarded several emails complaining about Lattouf to senior managers.The BBC has also seen dozens of WhatsApp messages from two groups that show a concerted letter-writing campaign against Lattouf in the days before she was fired.The ABC's barrister, Ian Neil SC, argued that Lattouf had not been fired and was simply told she wouldn't need to work the final two days of her contract, saying ""we're talking about two shifts, two programs.""Taking someone off air is designed to protect the ABC, not to punish the employee,"" Neil said in closing arguments.The Israeli military launched a campaign in Gaza in response to the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage.Lattouf - who is of Lebanese heritage - who is of Lebanese heritage - has been a regular contributor in Australian media for years, but also made a name for herself as an activist on issues like racism, discrimination in media and mental health.",Negative
Leaders arrive at Hague summit as Nato chief Rutte flatters Trump It is the US president's first Nato summit since 2019 and all 32 leaders are set to commit to a big hike in defence spending.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4gd98qry6jo,"– Twenty people were killed in Russian attacks on Ukraine on Tuesday, and the German chancellor said every attempt to bring Russia to the negotiating table had so far been unsuccessful.Missile attacks on the eastern city of Dnipro and the nearby town of Samar killed 17 people and wounded another 160, according to Ukrainian officials.The two-day NATO summit was to begin with a dinner hosted by the Dutch king, with a working session of under three hours on Wednesday and an expected five-paragraph statement at the end.The nine NATO countries that missed their defense spending targets could this be the most significant Nato summit since the Cold War?The wording of the commitment in the statement is key.While 3.5% of the target spending will cover core defense requirements, 1.5% will be spent on ""defense-related expenditure""—a broad expression that encompasses investments in anything from cybersecurity to infrastructure.The NATO secretary general earlier told his European colleagues to stop worrying about the US commitment to the Western alliance and focus on investing in defense and supporting Ukraine.Mark Rutte has spent much of the nine months since becoming Nato Secretary General working to get allies to commit to the 5% target.Many of the allies are far below the commitment to spend 3.5% of GDP on defense by 2035, but the German government backed a budget deal on Tuesday to hit that target by 2029.",Negative
Russian naval ship 'disguised' itself while passing through English Channel The Boikiy emitted a fake ID signal while sailing through the waterway alongside two sanctioned oil tankers.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c62gq6y62d1o,"– A Russian warship disguised itself using a fake ID code while traveling through the English Channel with two sanctioned oil tankers, a BBC Verify investigation has found.The Boikiy—a corvette armed with guided missiles—broadcast the fake ID code as it passed through the Channel on Saturday.On tracking sites it wrongly appeared as ships which have previously used that ID. BBC Verify matched the ID to the Boikiy by using satellite imagery, tracking data, and a video of it passing under a bridge in Denmark.It traveled alongside two vessels known to be part of Russia's ""shadow fleet""—a network of tankers whose ownership can be obscured and are used to transport sanctioned oil products.The action seems designed to deter the UK and other Nato states from attempting to board and, or, seize these vessels, since the presence of a military escort heightens the risk of confrontation and further escalation.""Normally, if the Russians want to remain hidden in secret, they just turn off their AIS signal,"" he said.It traveled alongside two vessels known to be part of Russia's ""shadow fleet""—a network of tankers whose ownership can be obscured and are used to transport sanctioned oil products.All ships are expected to broadcast the signal, though military vessels often sail without it.However, a vessel traveling under the generic identification number 400000000—a code sometimes used by vessels who want to alert others to their presence for safety reasons without identifying themselves—was seen briefly near the Canary Islands.The location is consistent with the time it could have taken the Boikiy to travel the 200km from Conakry.",Negative
"How a volatile 24 hours edged Iran and Israel to a ceasefire From an attack on a US air base to a fragile ceasefire, this is how the Middle East conflict changed overnight.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3vdpeq606do,"– Iran's state-controlled media began to report its retaliation was under way. Shortly after, the Iran's revolutionary guards confirmed as much.""US bases in the region are not strengths but vulnerabilities,"" it said—but the attack was over soon after.Qatar reacted before the US.The country is home to the al-Udeid military base, a sprawling installation outside the capital, Doha, which houses thousands of troops and is where US air operations in the Middle East are orchestrated.Iran then learned of a ""credible threat"" from an Iranian missile attack against the al-Udeid air base.The BBC then learned of a dizzying 24 hours beginning on Monday, events moved even faster: a US air base came under attack, the White House mediated a ceasefire between Iran and Israel, and that deal came close to unravelling.",Negative
South Korea banned dog meat. So what happens to the dogs? Advocates are concerned about the fate of half a million animals which face the threat of euthanasia.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c20r7lkel68o,"– When he isn't preaching the word of God, Reverend Joo Yeong-bong is raising dogs for slaughter.""Since last summer we've been trying to sell our dogs, but the traders just keep hesitating,"" Mr Joo, 60, tells the BBC.In 2024, the South Korean government implemented a nationwide ban on the sale of dog meat for consumption.The landmark legislation, which was passed last January, gives farmers like Mr Joo until February 2027 to shutter their operations and sell off their remaining animals.But many say that isn't enough time to phase out an industry which has propped up livelihoods for generations—and that authorities still haven't come up with adequate safeguards for farmers or the estimated half a million dogs in captivity.Even those who support the ban, including experts and animal rights advocates, have flagged issues around its enforcement—including the difficulty of rehoming dogs that, having been saved from the kill floor, now face the increasingly likely threat of euthanasia.The issue is further complicated by the fact that many are either pure or mixed tosa-inu, a breed that is classified as ""dangerous"" in South Korea and requires government approval to keep as a pet.The government sought to temper these concerns weeks later, saying that euthanising animals was ""certainly"" not part of their plan.A spokesperson from the Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs (Mafra) told the BBC that if farm owners gave up their dogs, local governments would assume ownership and manage them in shelters.Rehoming them, however, has proven challenging.Mr Joo, who is also president of the Korean Association of Edible Dogs, a group representing the industry, says: ""People are suffering.""If remaining dogs become 'lost and abandoned animals' then it's heartbreaking but they will be euthanised.",Negative
Sean 'Diddy' Combs' attorneys end their defence case after only 20 minutes Mr Combs also told the judge he would not take the stand in his defence as part of the weeks-long trial.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ce83yem82xpo,"– Sean ""Diddy"" Combs' legal team rested their case in his sex trafficking trial on Tuesday after making arguments for only about 20 minutes. His defense attorneys argued that the government has failed to meet the burden in proving any of the charges against him, which he's vehemently denied, and the judge should drop the case against him.Mr Combs also confirmed to the court that he would not take the stand in his own trial.The defense called none, instead submitting into evidence several text messages between Mr Combs and his ex-girlfriends, singer Casandra Ventura, and another victim who testified under the pseudonym Jane.Mr Combs has pleaded not guilty to charges of sex trafficking, racketeering, and transportation to engage in prostitution.His attorney Alexandra Shapiro argued that the victims in the case were capable women who could have left on their own accord, giving a hint of the points the legal team is likely to present during closing arguments scheduled later this week on Thursday and Friday.Mr Combs' lawyers gave a quick presentation, showing messages in an attempt to bolster their argument that Mr Combs' girlfriends were willing participants in sexual encounters with him and male escorts, which were called freak-offs.Mr Combs also confirmed to the court that he would not take the stand in his own trial.",Negative
UN condemns Gaza aid 'death trap' as dozens reported killed by Israeli fire,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c15wz2ee05do,"– At least 46 people waiting for aid have been killed by Israeli fire in two incidents in central and southern Gaza, according to rescuers and hospitals.UN agencies have condemned the US and Israel-backed food distribution system, with one official calling it ""an abomination"" and ""a death trap.""Such deadly incidents have recently become a near daily occurrence but have attracted relatively little attention outside Gaza since Israel attacked Iran more than a week ago.The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said a gathering had been ""identified in an area adjacent to IDF troops operating in the Netzarim corridor"".""Reports of injured individuals as a result of IDF fire in the area were received.The GHF said there were ""no incidents near any of our sites this morning.""Israel eased its total blockade of Gaza just over a month ago, and the GHF began operations a few days later.The UN and major aid groups have refused to co-operate with the foundation, accusing it of co-operating with Israel's goals in the 20-month-old war against Hamas in a way that violates humanitarian principles.However, Israel sees the GHF as key to a new phase of war in Gaza and is working to ensure its safe and continuous distribution, in accordance with international law.""Israel's militarised humanitarian assistance mechanism is in contradiction with international standards on aid distribution,"" he said.""The weaponization of food for civilians, in addition to restricting or preventing their access to life-sustaining services constitutes a war crime.""He added that it was for courts to decide if war crimes had been committed.",Negative
Millions of children at risk as vaccine uptake stalls,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1ljv2mvr00o,"– The global childhood vaccination program has been a huge success.Since 1974, more than four billion children have been vaccinated, preventing an estimated 150 million deaths worldwide.In nearly half a century until 2023, researchers say vaccine coverage doubled.But since 2010 progress has stagnated, to the extent that there are now wide variations in vaccine coverage around the world.A study, published in the medical journal The Lancet, says measles vaccinations have declined in nearly 100 countries.The Covid-19 pandemic made things even worse, because of disruption to vaccine programs during lockdowns.By 2023, there were nearly 16 million children who had not had any childhood vaccinations—most of them in sub-Saharan Africa and south Asia.Study author Dr Jonathan Mosser, from the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington, in the United States, says large numbers of children remain under-vaccinated and un-vaccinated.""Routine childhood vaccinations are among the most powerful and cost-effective public health interventions available, but persistent global inequalities, challenges from the Covid pandemic, and the growth of vaccine misinformation and hesitancy have all contributed to faltering immunisation progress,"" he said.Where it appears that policy is being made on the basis of ill-informed opinion, rather than science, we have a perfect storm,"" Dr Elliman added.",Positive
