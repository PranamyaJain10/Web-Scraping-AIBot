"Drought areas have trebled in size since 1980s, study finds Forty-eight percent of the world went through at least one month of extreme drought in 2023.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clyvje458rvo,"– The threshold for extreme drought is reached after six months of very low rainfall or very high levels of evaporation from plants and soil - or both.It poses an immediate risk to water and sanitation, food security and public health, and can affect energy supplies, transportation networks and the economy.The causes of individual droughts are complicated, because there are lots of different factors that affect the availability of water, from natural weather events to the way humans use land. But climate change is shifting global rainfall patterns, making some regions more prone to drought.Almost a third of the world - 30% - experienced extreme drought for three months or longer in 2023.In South Sudan, 77% of the country had at least one month of drought last year and half the country was in extreme drought for at least six months.The link between droughts, floods and global warming is complex.Hot weather increases the evaporation of water from soil which makes periods when there is no rain even drier.The Lancet Countdown report found the health impacts of climate change were reaching record-breaking levels. Drought exposed 151 million more people to food insecurity last year, compared with the 1990s, which has contributed to malnutrition.In the past 10 years, 61% of the world saw an increase in extreme rainfall, when compared with a baseline average from 1961-1990.",Neutral

How X users can earn thousands from US election misinformation and AI images The accounts are part of pro-Trump and pro-Harris networks sharing each other’s content multiple times a day.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx2dpj485nno,"– Some users on X who spend their days sharing content that includes election misinformation, AI-generated images and unfounded conspiracy theories say they are being paid ""thousands of dollars"" by the social media site.The BBC identified networks of dozens of accounts that re-share each other's content multiple times a day—including a mix of true, unfounded, false and faked material—to boost their reach, and therefore, revenue on the site.Several say earnings from their own and other accounts range from a couple of hundred to thousands of dollars.It raises questions about whether X is incentivising users to post provocative claims, whether they're true or not, at a highly sensitive moment for US politics.The BBC compared the approximate earnings reported by some of these X users with the amount they would be expected to earn, based on their number of views, followers and interactions with other profiles, and found them to be credible.Some of these profiles—which say they are not connected to official campaigns—have been contacted by US politicians, including congressional candidates, looking for supportive posts.",Positive
