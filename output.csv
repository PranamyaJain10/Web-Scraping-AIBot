The minute you stepped across that border, you were in the United States,"" Mari said.""It's ridiculous,"" says Panama City resident Mari, who asked not to have her surname published.""There's a treaty that he has to respect, and there's nothing in the treaty that says that we cannot have ports run by the Chinese,"" she told the BBC, pointing out that there is Chinese investment in American ports and cities.Mr Trump's comments about the canal included an unfounded claim that Chinese soldiers are operating it.",Positive
