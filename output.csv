It depends on what Witkoff has come with.""Beforehand, Witkoff had a meeting with Dmitriev at the Grand Hotel Europe in St Petersburg, where a conference was held on stainless steel and the Russian market.Trump has also had a fractious relationship with Zelensky since his second term as US president began, culminating in an angry confrontation in the Oval Office in February.The US attempted to broker a limited ceasefire between Ukraine and Russia in the Black Sea, only for it to stall when the Kremlin asked for sanctions imposed after it launched its full-scale invasion of its neighbor to be lifted.Trump has since said he is ""very angry"" and ""pissed off"" with Putin over the lack of progress in agreeing a truce between Kyiv and Moscow.On Friday, he declared that it would not have happened at all if he'd been in the White House in 2022 when Russia launched its full-scale invasion.""A war that should ld [sic] have never happened, and wouldn't have happened, if I were President!!!""",Negative
Judge allows deportation of pro-Palestinian activist over campus protest Mahmoud Khalil was arrested in March for his role in pro-Palestinian protests at  Columbia University.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwy0ngd11yzo,"– A US judge has ruled the Trump administration can deport Mahmoud Khalil, a Columbia University graduate detained last month over his role in pro-Palestinian protests.Mr Khalil, a permanent legal US resident, has not been charged with a crime.In a letter written from the facility, he has said his ""arrest was a direct consequence"" of speaking out for Palestinian rights.The government has cited a Cold War-era immigration law, declaring that his presence in the US was adverse to American foreign policy interests.The immigration court's ruling does not mean Mr Khalil would be immediately removed from the country.The judge gave his lawyers until 23 April to appeal against the order.Mr Khalil has been held at a Louisiana detention center since 8 March, when immigration officers told him he was being deported for taking part in protests against the war in Gaza.Mr Khalil's legal team has repeatedly said evidence of antisemitism has not been presented.The government, particularly Rubio, has said its efforts to deport Mr Khalil were also to ""protect Jewish students from harassment and violence in the United States"" even if his activities were ""otherwise lawful.""Mr Khalil has also filed a federal court lawsuit in New Jersey challenging his arrest as unconstitutional.The Trump administration has separately alleged that the student committed immigration fraud by failing to disclose certain information on his green card application.This includes working for the British embassy in Beirut and the United Nations agency for Palestinian migrants and refugees.Mr Khalil's legal team has repeatedly said evidence of antisemitism has not been presented.Mr Khalil's lawyer, Marc Van Der Hout, condemned the decision and said his team was going to fight for Mr Khalil's ""right to speak out against what's happening in the US.""I would like to quote what you said last time that there's nothing that's more important to this court than due process rights and fundamental fairness,"" he said in court.",Negative
"Everyone's jumping on the AI doll trend - but what are the concerns? As online users create Barbie-like dolls of themselves, experts urge caution over AI's energy and data use.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5yg690e9eno,"– It's part of a new trend where people use generative artificial intelligence (AI) tools like ChatGPT and Copilot to re-package themselves—literally—as pocket-sized dolls and action figures.It has taken off online, with brands and influencers dabbling in creating their mini-me.But some are urging people to steer clear of the seemingly innocent trend, saying fear of missing out shouldn't override concerns about AI's energy and data use.It may sound complicated, but the process is simple.People upload a picture of themselves to a tool like ChatGPT, along with written prompts that explain how they want the final picture to look.It did start to feel like a lot of work for a passing trend, and it isn't perfect—my doll is expanding out far beneath the supposed packaging.But more importantly, somewhere in a data center some hot computer servers were toiling away to make Action Figure Zoe.They almost certainly could have been put to work on worthier causes.Professor Gina Neff of Queen Mary University London told the BBC ChatGPT is ""burning through energy"", and the data centers used to power it consume more electricity in a year than 117 countries.It's not just regular people using it—the trend has been seized upon by a wealth of brands online including beauty company Mario Badescu and even Royal Mail. Trends come and go—but by their very nature can make people feel compelled to take part to avoid missing out.",Positive
"Trump to end protected status for Afghans and Cameroonians Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem found the conditions in both countries no longer merited US protections, a statement says.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cgeng08qe7zo,"– Thousands of Afghans and Cameroons will have their temporary deportation protections terminated, the US Department of Homeland Security has said.Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem found the conditions in Afghanistan and Cameroon no longer merited US protections, according to a statement from DHS assistant secretary Tricia McLaughlin.An estimated 14,600 Afghans previously eligible for temporary protected status (TPS) are now set to lose it in May, while some 7,900 Cameroonians will lose it in June.It comes on the same day a US judge ruled that the Trump administration could deport a university graduate, detained last month over his role in pro-Palestinian protests. TPS is granted to nationals of designated countries facing conditions, such as armed conflict or environmental disasters, which make it unsafe for them to return home.The status typically lasts for up to 18 months, can be renewed by the incumbent Homeland Security secretary, and offers deportation protection and access to work permits.According to McLaughlin, in September 2023 the then Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas announced that TPS for Afghans would be extended by 18 months until 20 May of this year.But on 21 March, having consulted with US government agencies, Noem ""determined that Afghanistan no longer continues to meet the statutory requirements for its TPS designation and so she terminated TPS for Afghanistan"", McLaughlin said.She added that Noem's decision was based on a United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) review of conditions in Afghanistan, where the Taliban retook control almost four years ago.",Positive

A Pentagon spokesman cited the article, saying ""undermining"" US leadership was not tolerated. Col Meyers had assumed command of the Arctic station in July last year.",Negative
"A bitter price hike in US coffee shops Higher prices are worrying independent US coffee shops, which import almost all their beans.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c807kxdp2l0o,"– The price of a cup of coffee in the US is going up as tariffs put the squeeze on local café and bakery owners.Some US businesses say the queues for a morning latte are already getting shorter as customers tighten their belts and imported beans become more expensive.Jorge Prudencio, who runs Bread Bite Bakery in Washington DC, says his Colombia-based coffee distributer just increased prices after the sweeping tariffs went into effect last week.Before the tariffs kicked in, ground coffee reached the highest ever recorded price in March 2025, and was over a dollar more expensive than the previous year, and $3 above March 2020 prices.""We have less customers for coffee,"" Mr Mortada said.Mr Prudencio remains confident that people will still come to his shop and buy coffee.He said they paid $42 per case when the bakery opened five months ago, but two weeks later it was more than $100 per case.Mr Mortada has also changed his own habits as a consumer.He said he has seen the price of a cup of coffee go up by at least half a dollar, and is worried prices will rise again.Mr Prudencio says his coffee suppliers have told him his next order will carry yet another price hike.He added that his bakery will ""definitely"" be increasing prices for customers just to break even.Mr Prudencio says: ""Of course.""",Neutral

His second in captivity.As he turns 48, somewhere in the tunnels of Gaza, Lishay will be writing again, with tales of two daughters who were still babies when he last saw them.Lishay's belief in her husband's survival seems unshakeable, but this is the toughest time of the year.Not just Omri's birthday, but also the eve of Pesach (Passover), when Jews celebrate the Biblical story of Exodus, in which Moses led their ancestors out of slavery in Egypt.Lishay says when we meet in a park near Tel Aviv's Hostages Square.""I don't feel free.I don't think anyone in Israel can feel free.""In the square itself, Omri's birthday was marked on Friday.The posters calling for his release once listed the hostage's age as 46.Lishay says she goes back to Nahal Oz from time to time to commune with her husband.The kibbutz is just 700m from the border with Gaza.It's as close as she can get to Omri.In a Passover message delivered on Friday, Netanyahu once again promised the families that hostages would return and Israel's enemies would be defeated.Recent days have seen talk of another ceasefire deal, but it doesn't feel imminent.Lishay says, referring to the first ceasefire deal in November 2023, ""we waited more than a year for another agreement.So now we are going to wait one year more?

"Why Beijing is not backing down on tariffs Amid a trade war with the US, our China correspondent explains why Beijing doesn't need to change tactics.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cjew7y4j724o,"– China's leader Xi Jinping told the visiting Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez on Friday that his country and the European Union should ""jointly resist the unilateral bullying practices"" of the Trump administration.Sanchez, in turn, said that China's trade tensions with the US should not impede its cooperation with Europe.Their meeting took place in the Chinese capital in the hours before Beijing again increased its tariffs on goods from the US - though it has said it will not respond to further US tariff increases.Next week Xi will visit Malaysia, Vietnam, and Cambodia.China's leaders would say that they are not inclined to cave in to a bully—something its government has repeatedly labelled the Trump administration as—but it also has a capacity to do this way beyond any other country on Earth.Trump has been bragging to his supporters that it would be easy to force China into submission by simply hitting the country with tariffs, but this has proven to be misleading in the extreme.Beijing is not going to surrender.",Negative
Starmer aims to take control of China-owned steel plant,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx20jr8rjj2o,"– Parliament will be recalled for a rare Saturday sitting to pass an emergency law aimed at saving British Steel's Scunthorpe plant from imminent closure.Sir Keir Starmer said the legislation would allow ministers to ""take control"" of the Lincolnshire site and stop its Chinese owner from closing its blast furnaces.The move opens the door to a full nationalization of the company at a later stage, with the prime minister saying ""all options"" remained on the table.""Jobs, investment, growth, our economic and national security are all on the line,"" the prime minister said.Earlier this week, the government offered to buy the coking coal to keep the blast furnaces running until a longer-term solution to saving the plant could be found, but was unable to get the company to agree to this in tense negotiations.The business department said the new law would give the government powers to order raw materials to keep the site's two running blast furnaces going, with supplies otherwise due to run out in the coming weeks.It added it would also allow ministers to direct the company's board and workforce, and ensure anyone at the plant ""who takes steps to keep it running, against the orders of the Chinese ownership"" can be reinstated if they are sacked.The company announced plans last month to shed jobs at the Scunthorpe site, which employs 2,700 people, blaming ""highly challenging"" market conditions, tariffs and costs associated with lower-carbon production techniques.The BBC understands from a senior government source the emergency legislation being voted on in Parliament on Saturday would not give ministers the power to nationalize British Steel - another bill would be needed to do that.Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch accused the government of having ""bungled"" the negotiations with British Steel.""They must have seen this coming for a while,"" she added.""Instead of addressing it earlier in the week when Parliament was sitting, their incompetence has led to a last-minute recall of Parliament,"" she added.",Negative
"Menendez brothers' bid for freedom can continue, judge rules",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cp8kmrg1p8go,"– The Menendez brothers were convicted of killing their parents in their Beverly Hills mansion in 1989, a notorious case that still divides Americans.Erik and Lyle Menendez appeared for hearing remotely via a video stream from a San Diego prison.Friday's ruling means a pair of high-profile hearings next week to decide whether the convicted killers will be resentenced, will continue. Los Angeles District Attorney Nathan Hochman has voiced fierce opposition to resentencing the pair, after his predecessor put the process in motion just before the November election.The brothers' effort is based on a California law that allows certain inmates who were aged under 26 at the time of their crimes to seek resentencing and potential parole eligibility - recognizing that brain development continues into a person's mid-20s.If the brothers are resentenced to 50 years to life as they have requested, it would make them immediately eligible for parole.The brothers' attorneys are attempting to have them resentenced to a lesser term, which could potentially make them eligible for freedom.The case was thrust back into the public eye last year as new evidence emerged and the release of a new Netflix drama, Monsters: The Lyle and Erik Menendez Story.The district attorney's office argued that while prosecutors can recognize inmates have rehabilitated while behind bars, the act of resentencing someone should be used with care.The brothers' effort is based on a California law that allows certain inmates who were aged under 26 at the time of their crimes to seek resentencing and potential parole eligibility - recognizing that brain development continues into a person's mid-20s.",Negative
