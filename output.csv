Backlash in Kenya over livestock vaccines and belching cows,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cj02rvvd8g2o,"– An ambitious initiative to vaccinate all livestock in Kenya is due to kick off this week amid fierce resistance from farmers that is being driven by misleading claims about the vaccines.It will cost farmers nothing to get their animals vaccinated as the government says it is footing the bill.But Robert Nkukuu, who keeps cattle in the Mai Mahiu area of Nakuru county - some 30km north-west of the capital, Nairobi, explained how it had become a toxic issue since President William Ruto announced the plan last November.""If the community here learns you are pro-vaccination they will slay you just now. So stop talking about it, we don't want it,"" he told the BBC.The government's aim is to vaccinate at least 22 million cattle and 50 million goats and sheep over three years.Currently only 10% of the national herd get the necessary vaccinations and the authorities say they want to raise that rate to 85% to make Kenya's livestock products eligible for export. President Ruto has dismissed the views of those opposing the vaccinations as ""simply misguided, unreasonable and possibly stupid"".""All of us who have been vaccinated, has anyone stopped farting?"" Ruto said as he dismissed the methane claims as ""nonsense,"" yet analysts say the spread of such conspiracy theories is down to poor communication by Ruto himself as well as low trust in his government following anti-tax protests last year and a series of corruption scandals.The government has faced a huge backlash over tax increases brought in since Ruto became president in 2022 - making it very unpopular.",Negative
