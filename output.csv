Trump offers Putin a way back in from the cold The BBC's Steve Rosenberg analyses how one phone call between Moscow and DC has already upended east-west relations.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c8ed3nk3n6ro,"– President Trump says negotiations on Ukraine war to begin 'immediately' after call with PutinIf that visit goes ahead, it will signify a major shift in US-Russian relations.An American president has not visited Russia for more than a decade.In many ways Putin has already got what he wants—the chance to negotiate directly with the United States on Ukraine, possibly over the heads of Kyiv and Europe—as well as the opportunity to put himself at the top table of international politics.It remains unclear, though, how far Putin will be willing to compromise.But President Vladimir Putin has already scored something of a diplomatic victory simply by holding this telephone conversation.After all, three years ago he was out in the political wilderness. Putin's decision to launch a full-scale invasion of Ukraine had turned him into a pariah.The United Nations General Assembly overwhelmingly adopted a resolution condemning Russia for its ""unlawful use of force against Ukraine."" Russia was hit by thousands of international sanctions.",Positive
Beginnings of Roman London discovered in office basement The discovery has been described as one of the most important pieces of Roman history in the City of London.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx2jdnv0ywyo,"– A discovery underneath the basement of an office block has been described as one of the most important pieces of Roman history unearthed in the city of London.Archaeologists have found a substantial piece of the ancient city's first basilica—a 2,000 year old public building where major political, economic and administrative decisions were made.The excavation has so far revealed sections of stone wall that formed the base of the basilica, which would have been two-and-a-half storeys high.The site, which will eventually be opened to the public, sheds light on the city's beginnings. ""This is so significant - this is the heart of Roman London,"" said Sophie Jackson, from the Museum of London Archaeology (Mola), who revealed the new find exclusively to BBC News.The basilica was part of London's forum, a social and commercial hub with a courtyard that was about the size of a football pitch.""The basilica is the town hall, and then in front of it was a big open market square with a range of shops and offices around the outside,"" explained Ms Jackson.""It's the place you came to do business, to get your court case sorted out, it's where laws were made, and it's where decisions were made about London, but also about the rest of the country.""It was built around 80 AD, just a few decades after the Romans invaded Britain and founded Londinium—the Roman name for the city.But the first basilica and forum were only in use for about 20 years.",Positive

"Confusion clouds efforts to save Gaza ceasefire Egypt and Qatar are ""intensifying diplomatic efforts"" as concern grows that fighting will resume.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cd7d9p0j5qeo,"– Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said: ""If Hamas does not return our hostages by Saturday noon, the ceasefire will end and the [Israeli military] will resume intense fighting."" However, there has been mixed messaging on whether he means all 76 hostages still in Gaza - in line with the high-stakes ultimatum recommended by US President Donald Trump.""However, there has been mixed messaging on whether he means all 76 hostages still in Gaza - in line with the high-stakes ultimatum recommended by US President Donald Trump.Trump was reacting to a Hamas threat to derail the agreement on Monday.It complained of Israeli ceasefire violations, in particular relating to aid, and warned that it would delay the release of hostages on Saturday.The relative calm has allowed hundreds of thousands of displaced Palestinians to return to their own neighborhoods and brought in a surge of humanitarian aid.However, the current impasse stems from Hamas's claim that Israel has not upheld its promises for the first phase of the truce.It says that this required Israeli authorities to allow about 300,000 tents and 60,000 caravans into Gaza.The fact that the Hamas leader for Gaza, Khalil al-Hayya, is leading a delegation to follow up on implementation in Cairo, shows that the armed group is also trying to get the ceasefire agreement back on track.Since 19 January, the deal has seen a total of 16 Israeli hostages brought home in exchange for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners held by Israel.",Negative
