UK MPs back assisted dying bill in historic vote The bill would allow terminally ill adults in England and Wales to end their own lives.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cgeqj1egxvyo,"– In an historic vote, MPs have approved a bill which would pave the way for huge social change by giving terminally ill adults in England and Wales the right to end their own lives.The Terminally Ill Adults Bill, which was backed by 314 votes to 291, will now go to the House of Lords for further scrutiny.The bill was approved with a majority of 23 MPs, representing a drop from the first time it was debated in November, when it passed by a margin of 55.The vote came after an emotionally-charged debate which saw MPs recount personal stories of seeing friends and relatives die.It is likely, although not guaranteed, that the House of Lords will approve the bill later this year. If that happens, ministers would have a maximum of four years to implement the measures, meaning it could be 2029 before assisted dying becomes available. Dame Esther Rantzen, a broadcaster and prominent supporter of the bill, said: ""This will make a huge positive difference, protecting millions of terminally ill patients and their families from the agony and loss of dignity created by a bad death.""On the other side, Baroness and former Paralympian Tanni Grey-Thompson said she had heard from ""disabled people [who] are absolutely terrified"" about the bill.",Positive

'They are shooting a lot': Voice notes from a Gaza hospital as war closes in The director of al-Awda hospital describes its deteriorating conditions and eventual closure in voice notes sent to the BBC.,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/resources/idt-fd97bd85-5060-4a09-8525-053aee434cf7,"– ""They are shooting a lot. The tank has sieged the hospital."" Gunfire can be heard in the background of a hushed voice note sent in the middle of the night from inside al-Awda hospital, described by the World Health Organization last month as the ""last functioning hospital in North Gaza."" A week later, the hospital was declared out of service and the medical staff, including the director, Mohammed Salha, who recorded the voice note, were forced to evacuate and head south. With fewer than half of Gaza's hospitals now running - and those that are only at a limited capacity - there are warnings from groups like the WHO and British Red Cross that the health system is being ""systematically dismantled"" and ""on the brink of collapse"", as the number of casualties from the 20-month war continues to rise. Salha says the hospital is running on a small generator and is also struggling to deal with the effects of a total Israeli blockade now in its 10th week, causing shortages of medical supplies and fuel. Over a period of two weeks, Salha sent regular voice notes to the BBC from inside the hospital, including at times when it could not be reached by patients or journalists, tracking its rapid deterioration until the moment it shut down completely.",Negative

Now the main discussions will last just three hours and the summit statement is being reduced to five paragraphs, reportedly because of the US president's demands.Trump is one of 32 leaders from the Western defensive alliance who are coming, along with the heads of more than a dozen partner countries.Dutch police have mounted their biggest ever security operation for the most expensive Nato summit so far, at a cost of 183.4m (£155m; $210m).Some have suggested the brevity of the summit is in part to cater to the US president's attention span and dislike of long meetings.Secretary General Mark Rutte has already settled on the menu for their meeting at The Hague: one that will avoid a row with Nato's most powerful member, the US.A commitment to increase defense spending by European allies is the dish that President Donald Trump wants served—and that's exactly what he'll be getting.",Positive
