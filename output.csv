Poisoned water and scarred hills: BBC visits world's rare earths capital in China China has paid a steep price for mining the rare earth metals the world wants.,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/resources/idt-66cdf862-5e96-4e6e-90b8-a407b597c8d9,"– China is home to half of the world's supply of a group of metals known as rare earths. They are key components in nearly everything that we switch on: smartphones, bluetooth speakers, computers, TV screens, even electric vehicles. And one country, above all others, has leapt ahead in mining them and refining them: China. But China has paid a steep price for it. To find out more, we traveled to the country's two main rare earth mining hubs—Bayan Obo in the north and Ganzhou in the province of Jiangxi in the south. The town gets its name from the district it sits in, which is home to half of the world's supply of a group of metals known as rare earths. As of 1999, the open-pit mines had already produced huge piles of 'tailings' or waste material. Further south, in the mining hub of Ganzhou, small, circular concrete ponds full of toxic waste sit on top of steep, eroded hilltops—many of the pools are uncovered and open to the elements. Local farmer Huang Xiaocong, whose land is surrounded by four rare earth sites, believes landslides are still being triggered by improper mining practices. But significant damage had been done to the area already.",Negative
"Images reveal devastation caused by Texas floods Volatile weather, unusual humidity and the Texan landscape all contributed to the scale of destruction.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/resources/idt-3e86df88-5679-4f65-914f-97014d8a188f,"– As the search continues for those still missing, questions are being asked whether more could have been done to prevent such huge loss of life. Experts say there was a large supply of moisture in the atmosphere from a tropical storm that had caused flooding in Mexico and then tracked north as it died out. Kerr County, where the camp was located and where 75 lives have been lost, is a hillier part of Texas than surrounding counties. The National Weather Service reported a swathe of around 5-10in (125-250mm) of rainfall in just three to six hours across south-central Kerr County. Average July rainfall over the last 25 years for the Kerrville area is just over two inches, which means around four months of rain fell in a matter of hours. The timing also contributed to the loss of life - many Texans had gone to bed on the Thursday night unaware such a catastrophic storm would wake them in terror in just a few hours.",Negative
