Three dead in suspected Christmas cake poisoning Police say arsenic was detected in the blood of family members who ate the cake in Torres.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c623lerlr19o,"– Arsenic has been found in the blood of one of three women who died after eating a Christmas cake in a suspected poisoning in Brazil, a police chief has told local media.The highly toxic substance was also identified in the blood test results of a 10-year-old boy and the woman who made the cake—both of whom are still in hospital.Five members of the same family fell ill after eating the cake at a gathering in Torres, in the southern Rio Grande do Sul state, on Monday afternoon.Police have sent the cake for testing, and said several out-of-date food items were also found during a search at the woman's house.They added that it is not yet clear whether the suspected poisoning was intentional. Arsenic is a metallic element that occurs naturally.Its inorganic form is highly toxic and classified as a category one carcinogen by the EU - meaning it's known to cause cancer in humans.According to the World Health Organization (WHO), people are exposed to elevated levels of inorganic arsenic through drinking contaminated water or using it in food preparation, as well as irrigation of crops, industrial processes and smoking tobacco.Because arsenic exists in soil, small amounts can get into food, though in general these levels are so low that they are not considered a cause for concern.It is also used, albeit in limited cases, in pesticides and pharmaceuticals.Six out of seven people ate the cake on Monday afternoon, including the woman who baked it.Police told Brazilian broadcasters that she is the only one believed to have eaten two slices of her homemade cake, and her tests returned the highest levels of arsenic.",Negative
