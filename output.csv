Altman posted on Musk's social media platform X: ""no thank you but we will buy twitter for $9.74 billion if you want.""

We will make sure that happens,"" Musk said in a statement.The offer tabled at $97.4bn is much lower than the $157bn the company was valued at in its latest funding round in October last year.Altman is said to be restructuring the company to become a for-profit entity, stripping it of its non-profit board.",Positive
