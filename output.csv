FBI issues warning over two fake election videos Evidence seen by the BBC links the videos to a Russian-based operation of election disinformation.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cly2qjel083o,"– The FBI has warned of two fake videos circulating online that aim to cast doubt around the US presidential election—the latest in a series of alerts by top officials.BBC Verify found evidence linking the videos to a much larger, Russia-based operation that has produced hundreds of fakes directed at the election in recent months.In a post on X on Saturday, the FBI said the two videos were spreading rumors about ballot fraud and about Doug Emhoff, the husband of Democrat candidate Vice-President Kamala Harris.The videos have been posted online nearly every day for months and have recently focused on the US election, including clips promoting false claims about Harris and messages about unrest and ""civil war.""According to X's metrics, the clips have been viewed tens of thousands of times, but are posted by accounts with few followers, and attract very few comments—tell-tale signs that the view count is being amplified by fake 'bot' accounts.The FBI declined to comment on the operation, but along with agencies the bureau has issued two other warnings in recent days about Russia-linked influence networks.On Friday, three US agencies including the FBI, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency stated that a viral video that ""falsely depicted individuals claiming to be from Haiti"" voting was made by ""Russian influence actors.""Last week intelligence agencies said a video purporting to show a poll worker destroying mail-in ballots marked for Donald Trump in Pennsylvania was ""manufactured and amplified"" by Russians.",Negative
