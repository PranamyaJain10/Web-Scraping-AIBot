'A long fight full of tears': Why Thailand became a haven for LGBT couples,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cly92g14edro,"– ""It has been a long fight full of tears for us."" That is how Ann ""Waaddao"" Chumaporn describes the years that led to this moment—on Thursday, when same-sex marriage becomes legal in Thailand, and more than a hundred couples will tie the knot in one of Bangkok's biggest shopping malls, in a riot of color and celebration.The same question which has been heard throughout the long campaign to get the equal marriage law passed will be asked again: why Thailand? Why nowhere else, aside from Taiwan and Nepal, in Asia?People think they know the answer. Thailand is famously open to and accepting of lesbian, gay, bisexual and trans people. They have long been visible in all walks of life. The first Pride march in Thailand took place only 25 years ago. Back then it was hard to get approval from the police, and the march was a chaotic, unfocused event. The resumption of Pride marches in 2022, and getting the government to recognize and promote the appeal of Thailand as an attractive destination for LGBT travellers also helped change public perceptions.""We did not fight, we negotiated,"" Mr Tinnaphop says.",Negative
