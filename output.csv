How would Trump’s promise of mass deportations of migrants work? The mass deportation of undocumented immigrants would face legal and practical challenges - and cost billions.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ce9z0lm48ngo,"– Donald Trump has doubled down on his campaign promise of the mass deportation of illegal immigrants, saying the cost of doing so will not be a deterrent.In some of his first public remarks since winning the election, Trump said his priority upon taking office in January would be to make the border ""strong and powerful"".""It's not a question of a price tag. It's not - really, we have no choice,"" Trump told NBC News.""When people have killed and murdered, when drug lords have destroyed countries, and now they're going to go back to those countries because they're not staying here.There is no price tag.""While his campaign has given various answers as to how many could be removed, his vice-president-elect JD Vance had said they would start with one million.Experts say there are significant legal and practical challenges to expelling so many people at once.Trump has pledged to take action against these ""sanctuary cities,"" but America's patchwork of local, state, and federal laws further complicates the picture. Kathleen Bush-Joseph, a policy analyst at the Washington-based Migration Policy Institute, or MPI, said that co-operation between Ice and local officials would be a ""critical"" aspect of any mass deportation program.Most immigrants already in the country enter into the deportation system not through encounters with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) agents but through local law enforcement.However, many of the country's largest cities and counties have passed laws restricting local police co-operation with Ice.",Negative
"US central bank boss says Trump can't fire him The US central bank cuts interest rates, as its chairman vows to stay on the job.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn4v7vwgqj0o,"– The Federal Reserve chairman has hit back at speculation that his post might be in jeopardy as Donald Trump prepares to assume power in Washington.Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell said he would not step down if Trump asked and that it is ""not permitted under law"" for the White House to force him out.Mr Powell was responding to questions from reporters at a press conference after the bank announced a cut to borrowing costs, lowering the Fed's key lending rate to the range of 4.5%-4.75%.Mr Powell was responding to questions from reporters at a press conference after the bank announced a cut to borrowing costs, lowering the Fed's key lending rate to the range of 4.5%-4.75%.Mr Powell was named chairman of the Fed by Trump in 2017, but later become a frequent target of his criticism.Mr Powell said on Thursday officials expected to continue to cut rates, but how fast and how far remained to be seen.Mr Powell said officials expected to find the right pace and destination as we go.""It's such an early stage - we don't know what the policies are, we don't know when they will be implemented,"" he said.Mr Powell said on Thursday officials remained equally focused on keeping prices stable and the job market healthy.Though concerns flared earlier this year about rising unemployment, those quietened in September, after data showed an unexpectedly strong burst of hiring.Mr Powell said on Thursday officials expected to continue to cut rates, but how fast and how far remained to be seen.Mr Powell resisted questions seeking more precise guidance seeking more precise guidance.Mr Powell said officials expected to continue to cut rates, but how fast and how far remained to be seen.In the US, it seems to be doing a lot of further guidance compared to what many had originally hoped for.""We don't think it't be a good time to be doing a lot of further guidance.",Positive
Did the US election polls fail? Polls predicted a tight race - then Donald Trump won a commanding victory. So what went wrong?,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cj4ve004llxo,"– For much of the 2024 US presidential campaign, polls and pundits rated the race too close to call.Then Donald Trump delivered a commanding victory over Kamala Harris, winning at least five battleground states, and performing unexpectedly well in other places.He is now poised to become the first Republican in two decades to win the popular vote, and could enter office with a Republican-controlled House and Senate at his back.So were the polls wrong about it being a tight contest? In some less closely-watched parts of the US, polls underestimated Trump's support more significantly—a sign of some blind spots, said Michael Bailey, a professor at Georgetown University and author of the book Polling at a Crossroads.""At a glance, in the battleground states, polls ran a little hot for Harris but really not so bad, but when you dig deeper, it's all a little less impressive,"" he said.In Florida, for example, polls tracked by RealClearPolitics in the final weeks of the election put Trump ahead by about five points.He won by a greater margin of 13.In New Jersey, Harris was expected to win by nearly 20 percentage points, based on the two most recent polls tracked by the site.His margin was more slender, closer to 10.""Just imagine if we knew that or had a better sense of that a month ago.I don't know that it would change the election but it would certainly change our expectations,"" Prof Bailey said.He said pollsters this year may have leaned too heavily on bets that people would behave roughly as they did in 2020—failing to anticipate the depth of the swing among Latino and young voters toward Trump.",Positive

Republicans were seven seats short of the 218 seats needed to take control on Thursday morning. Democrats need 15 more.The Senate, or upper chamber, and the White House have already flipped to Republicans so President-elect Donald Trump could have total control when he is sworn in on 20 January 2025.Control of the House, the lower chamber, gives a party the power to initiate spending legislation and launch impeachment proceedings against officials. Here are some of the races that have yet to be called.",Positive

"The view from countries where Trump's win really matters An opportunity, a respite or a security fear - we assess how Trump's return to power is being viewed elsewhere.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4gpd2487e5o,"– Donald Trump's victory has made global headlines.His so-called America First foreign policy could see a withdrawal of US involvement in areas of conflict around the world.Five BBC correspondents assess the effect it could have where they are.The Republican once vowed to end the war in a single day, and has repeatedly criticized US military aid for Ukraine.Still, the Kremlin is going out of its way to give the impression that it's not excited by a Trump victory.Trump won't just have to consider further military support for Ukraine, but also how or whether to respond to North Korea's growing involvement in Russia's invasion.The dampening down of expectations are the result of how Trump's first term turned out: the Kremlin had high hopes that a Trump presidency would transform US-Russian relations.Still, at the political discussion club I'm attending in the mountains above Sochi, leading Russian political scientists seem to be looking forward to Trump the sequel.One pundit told me he thinks that under Trump the US will ""retreat"" from its global super power status.Trump won't just have to consider further military support for Ukraine, but also how or whether to respond to North Korea's growing involvement in Russia's invasion.",Positive

When does Trump become US president again? Republican Donald Trump will be the next US president after securing a second term in the White House.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cde7ng85jwgo,"– Republican Donald Trump will be the next US president - after a decisive victory that will send him back to the White House.His defeated opponent, Democrat Kamala Harris, urged her supporters to accept Trump's win, and insisted there must be a peaceful transfer of power.He will be the first former president to return to office in more than 130 years, and—at 78—the oldest man ever elected to the role.

Trump will be sworn in at the presidential inauguration on Monday, 20 January 2025, at which point he legally assumes the power and responsibilities of the presidency.It was this meeting of Congress, to certify the election results, that Trump's supporters tried to stop, when they marched on the US Capitol in 2021 after Trump refused to concede defeat to Joe Biden.",Positive
"'It's simple, really' - why Latinos flocked to Trump's working-class coalition As well as winning over Hispanic voters, Trump improved his position in some surprising corners.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cze3yr77j9wo,"– Donald Trump has soared to a decisive election victory over Kamala Harris, lifted up by some of the very voters that Democrats once relied on.The Republican president-elect showed strength with the white working-class voters who first propelled him to the White House in 2016, while racking up huge support from Latino voters and putting in a better-than-expected performance among younger Americans, especially men.Among Latinos, a key part of the Democratic voter base for decades, Trump benefited from a mammoth 14 percentage-point bump compared to the 2020 election, according to exit polls.In his victory speech in Florida, Trump—who is set to win the popular vote too—thanked the result to ""the biggest, the broadest, the most unified coalition"" in American history.In Pennsylvania, the prized battleground state, Trump benefited from a huge swell of support from the state's growing Latino population.

Trump garnered 42% of that vote, compared to 27% when he ran against Joe Biden in 2020.Michael Wagner, a professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, said her direct appeals to working-class voters may not have made much of a difference given the national political climate.In 2020 Joe Biden had a 24-point advantage with voters under 30.This time, that lead shrank to just 11 points.",Positive
