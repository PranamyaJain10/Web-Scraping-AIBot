"India looks on nervously as Trump wields tariff threat Delhi hopes tariff cuts have put it ahead of the game - but will that satisfy Trump, or is trade action still on the table?",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn93eyp5r2zo,"– India further slashed import duties on motorcycles, cutting tariffs on heavyweight bikes with engines above 1,600cc from 50% to 30% and smaller ones from 50% to 40%.A pre-emptive move designed to further smoothen the entry of Harley Davidsons into India—and, Delhi hopes, ward off any threat of tariffs.Donald Trump has marked his return to the White House by brandishing trade measures against America's neighbours and allies as well as its big rival China.India enjoys a trade surplus with the US, its top trading partner.India finally opened up in the 1990s and 2000s, cutting average tariffs from 80% in 1990 to 13% in 2008.But after Modi launched his 'Make in India' policy to boost manufacturing in India tariffs have climbed again to about 18% - higher than those set by other Asian nations such as China, South Korea, Indonesia and Thailand.Trade expert Biswajit Dhar believes India is now a prime target under Trump's 'America First' policy, which seeks reciprocal action against high import taxes and reassesses trade with large US deficits.India dropped tariffs on US-made almonds, apples, chickpeas, lentils and walnuts in 2023, but Trump will likely demand more.India also scrapped tariffs on select waste and scrap items, a category where US exports amounted to $2.5bn last year.While Trump has criticized India's tariff policies, the latest reductions signal a policy shift that could enhance US exports across various sectors,"" says Mr Srivastava.""With key tariff cuts on technology, automobiles, industrial and waste imports, India appears to be taking steps towards facilitating trade even as the global trade environment remains tense.""India finally opened up in the 1990s and 2000s, cutting average tariffs from 80% in 1990 to 13% in 2008.""Canada and Mexico are literally two arms of the US,"" says Ajay Srivastava, founder of the Delhi-based think tank Global Trade Research Institute (GTRI).",Negative

Trump faces moment of reckoning on trade after delaying tariffs The president will soon have to decide whether to match his trade rhetoric with action or shelve his tariff plans.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c6264g7z2ewo,"– President Trump has delayed imposing those tariffs on his North American neighbors for a month after both countries agreed new border measures, the president still faces a moment of reckoning in which he will ultimately have to decide whether to match his rhetoric with action.Trump often talks of the trade deficits between the US and its two neighbours as a key source of his dissatisfaction.If that's the case, then no amount of new border security or drug seizures—whatever the metrics or specific demands—will make the president fully abandon his tariff threats.The details of what Canada and Mexico conceded, however, paint a more complicated picture.While Canada agreed to form a joint anti-crime strike force with the US and appoint a ""fentanyl tsar"", the concrete steps it detailed were all part of a border-security package Canada had previously announced.Mexico pledged stepped up drug enforcement and 10,000 troops to patrol the US-Mexico border—but those numbers mirror the deployments the nation made in 2019 and again in 2021In a month's time, Trump will again have to decide if Canada and Mexico are doing enough to satisfy his demands—or whether the delayed tariffs will go into effect.The opening salvos have been fired in Trump's trade war—what comes next?What are tariffs and why is Trump threatening to use them?Who won and lost as Trump's trade war is delayed—for nowBy the administration's own measures, US immigration officials only seized 43lbs (19.5kg) of fentanyl and caught 193,540 people crossing at the US-Canada border in 2024.",Negative

How does fentanyl get into the US?,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvg93nn1e6go,"– President Trump has imposed sweeping tariffs on Chinese goods, citing Beijing's failure to stop the export of chemicals used in the production of the powerful opioid fentanyl.The US has long accused Chinese corporations of knowingly supplying groups involved in the creation of the drug. Beijing has hit back with tariffs of its own.The White House has also accused Canada and Mexico of failing to prevent criminal gangs from smuggling fentanyl into the US.Trump had planned tariffs against both those countries but he suspended that threat after winning some concessions on increased border security. Fentanyl is a synthetic drug manufactured from a combination of chemicals. US regulators approved it for use in medical settings as a pain reliever in the 1960s, but it has since become the main drug responsible for opioid overdose deaths in the US.Over 74,000 Americans died in 2023 after taking drug mixtures containing fentanyl, according to the US Centers for Disease Control (CDC).It is frequently mixed with other illicit drugs, leading many users to be unaware that the substances they are consuming contain fentanyl.In a statement, China said it had some of the strictest drugs laws in the world and had conducted joint operations with the US in the past.""The US needs to view and solve its own fentanyl issue,"" it said.",Negative
