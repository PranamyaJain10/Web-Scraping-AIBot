Prime Minister Pedro Snchez has declared three days of national mourning as the extreme conditions continue, restricting some rescue efforts.One of the first towns affected near Valencia, Chiva, reported one year's worth of rainfall on Tuesday in just a period of eight hours, according to national weather agency Aemet.As Spanish army and emergency crews rushed to carry out rescues on Wednesday morning—including winching people to safety from balconies and car rooftops— survivors in Valencia recounted the horror of the floods on Tuesday night.Guillermo Serrano Pérez, 21, from Paiporta near Valencia, said the water had rushed down a highway ""like a tsunami,"" forcing him and his parents to abandon their car and climb on to a bridge to survive.The flooding death toll is the country's worst since 1973, when at least 150 people were estimated to have died in the nation's worst-ever floods in the south-east.Weather researchers have identified the likely main cause of the intense rainfall as a ""gota fria""—a natural weather event that hits Spain in autumn and winter when cold air descends on warmer waters over the Mediterranean.The European Union's chief, Ursula von der Leyen, said it had activated its Copernicus satellite system to help co-ordinate Spanish rescue teams.",Negative
