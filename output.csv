"Iran pauses controversial new dress code law President Massoud Pezeshkian says the proposed ""hijab and chastity"" law is ""ambiguous and in need of reform"".",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0mv83m4z7vo,"– Iran's National Security Council has paused the implementation of the controversial ""hijab and chastity law"", which had been due to come into force on Friday, signalling his intention to reassess its measures.The proposed new law—which would introduce harsher punishments for women and girls for exposing their hair, forearms, or lower legs—had been heavily criticized by rights activists.The strict dress codes imposed on women and girls, which have been treated as a national security priority by the rulers of the Islamic Republic of Iran for decades, have previously triggered protests.Under the new law, repeat offenders and anyone who mocked the rules would face heavier fines and longer prison sentences of up to 15 years in jail.President Massoud Pezeshkian called the legislation ""ambiguous and in need of reform"", signalling his intention to reassess its measures.The decision to pause its implementation suggests the government fears it could trigger another wave of mass protests, like those seen two years ago.Pezeshkian's supporters believe the new hijab law will fail to discourage young women from defying it and could even worsen the situation.Human rights groups had expressed alarm.Last week, more than 300 Iranian rights activists, writers and journalists publicly condemned the new hijab law, calling it ""illegitimate and unenforceable"" and urged Pezeshkian to honor his campaign promises.",Negative

""This term everybody wants to be my friend."" It may have been a typically Trumpian overstatement, but the contrast between the way his first presidential term began—and ended—and the current transition to his second term eight years later is dramatic.In just the past few weeks, many of the president-elect's former critics and adversaries have made overtures and outreach.Jeff Bezos of Amazon, Mark Zuckerberg of Meta and Sam Altman of OpenAI have pledged million-dollar donations to Trump's inauguration.The day before Thanksgiving, Zuckerberg, whose Facebook had once banned Trump, traveled to the president-elect's private club in Florida for dinner.And when Trump appeared on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange to ring the opening bell and mark his announcement as Time Magazine's ""person of the year"" last week, senior executives from major US corporations gathered to watch.""The increasingly accommodating attitude isn't confined solely to the corporate boardrooms.Senate Republicans who had seemed wary of confirming some of Trump's more controversial political appointees, such as Fox News host Pete Hegseth for secretary of defense, are falling in line as they face increasing pressure not just from Trump but from his supporters, who warn of dire consequences for the uncooperative.Even some Democrats are reaching out to the incoming Trump administration.",Negative

"Amazon aware of warehouse injury risk, report finds",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clyjm507462o,"– Amazon pushes its US warehouse workers to fulfill orders at speeds that could cause high rates of injury despite being aware of the risks, an investigation led by Senator Bernie Sanders has found. The findings, following an 18-month probe of the firm, support claims that workers and labor campaigners have made about the company for years. But Amazon said the report was ""wrong on the facts"", and featured ""selective, outdated information that lacks context and isn't grounded in reality."" Sen. Sanders and his staff chose to rely on the debunked Soteria analysis because it fits the false narrative he wanted to build,"" the company added. Amazon had internally examined connections between workplace speed and injury rates, including in a review called Project Soteria, according to the investigation. But the report said the company opted not to adopt the recommended changes, which included providing more time off to workers, and halting disciplinary action against people who did not meet working speed requirements.Investigators also accused Amazon of trying to ""manipulate"" data to mislead the public about its safety record. Amazon said it was fair for the firm to focus safety comparisons on larger warehouses.",Positive
