Trump's critics and supporters unite against Qatar plane deal The White House has doubled down on the proposed deal which has been criticised by some of the president's top supporters.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckg4zk22n9wo,"– Donald Trump has achieved a remarkable feat, uniting many partisans across America's bitter political divide.The problem for the White House is that unity is happening in opposition to it.The current fleet includes two 747-200 jets which have been in use since 1990, along with several smaller and somewhat secretive 757s.The White House says that the new plane—which could require years and millions of dollars to refit and upgrade—will be transferred to Trump's presidential library at the end of his term.Trump found little support for the plan in more mainstream outlets as well.The New York Post, which usually can be counted on to back much of the populist Maga agenda, ran a blunt editorial: ""Qatar's 'Palace in the Sky' jet is NOT a 'free gift' - and Trump shouldn't accept it as one.""Is Trump allowed to accept a $400m luxury plane as a gift?In response to criticism of the deal, the White House has doubled down.Although there has been nothing offered in exchange for the plane, many commentators said it would be nave to expect that that Qatari royal family would hand out such a large item with no strings attached.The US Constitution includes a clause preventing officials from accepting ""any present, Emolument, Office, or Title, of any kind whatever, from any King, Prince, or foreign state.""But the White House has pointed out that the administration was ""committed to full transparency.""",Negative
