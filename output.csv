Georgescu called that decision a ""direct blow to democracy.""Tear gas was fired at supporters of the presidential hopeful as violence broke out between them and police while they gathered in their thousands outside the offices of the BEC in the capital Bucharest.The 62-year-old independent came from nowhere to win the first round of last year's election, the results of which were annulled just days before the second round of voting.One key to his sudden popularity was his promise to ""restore Romania's dignity"" and end subservience to the international organizations it belongs to, including Nato and the EU.Georgescu has also seen some support from the Trump administration.Last month, US Vice-President JD Vance accused Romania of annulling the elections based on the ""flimsy suspicions"" of Romanian intelligence and pressure from its neighbors.Meanwhile, Romanian Foreign Minister Emil Hurezeanu accused Elon Musk of a ""form of interference"" in Romania's elections, after the billionaire posted several messages of support for Georgescu.",Positive
