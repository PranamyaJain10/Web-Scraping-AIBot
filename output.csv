"Robert Roberson's execution can resume, Texas Supreme Court rules The Texas man was meant to be executed last month, but it was temporarily stopped at the last minute.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cq6lvd6pr0eo,"– A Texas Supreme Court has said the execution of Robert Roberson—a Texas man who was convicted of killing his two-year-old daughter—can proceed. He was set to be the first person in the US to be executed for a murder related to ""shaken baby syndrome""—but legal challenges, prompted by some public outcry, paused the execution at the last minute last month.The Texas Supreme Court's decision means a state court judge will set a new execution date. Roberson has long maintained his innocence. His lawyers say new evidence shows the child died of complications from pneumonia.Just hours before Roberson, 57, was set to be executed on 17 October, a bipartisan group of lawmakers in the Texas House of Representatives issued a subpoena for him to testify in a hearing that would take place after his execution date.A Travis County judge then issued a temporary restraining order to stop the execution going ahead before the hearing took place.But on Friday, weeks after that subpoena was issued, the Texas Supreme Court said that group of lawmakers did not have the authority to override Roberson's scheduled execution with a subpoena and the execution should now move forward. Roberson was originally sentenced to death in 2003 for the death of his daughter, Nikki Curtis. A post-mortem examination found she died of injuries from abuse but Roberson says his daughter fell out of her bed and when he returned hours later she was not breathing. While medical staff immediately suspected abuse, Roberson's lawyers argued his daughter was prescribed medicines that are no longer given to children because they can cause serious complications and that, along with the fall, was the cause of her death.",Negative
