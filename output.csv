"European leaders tentatively hopeful after call with Trump ahead of Putin summit Trump, who described the call as ""a ten"", was urged to keep Ukraine's interests at the forefront when he meets Putin on Friday.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cpv0l9e187yo,"– European leaders appeared cautiously optimistic after holding a virtual meeting with Donald Trump on Wednesday, two days before he meets his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin in Alaska to discuss ending the war in Ukraine.Trump reportedly told the Europeans that his goal for the summit was to obtain a ceasefire between Moscow and Kyiv.He also agreed that any territorial issues had to be decided with Volodymyr Zelensky's involvement, and that security guarantees had to be part of the deal, according to France's Emmanuel Macron.Trump and Vice-President JD Vance spoke to the leaders of the UK, France, Germany, Italy, Finland and Poland as well as EU chief Ursula von der Leyen and NATO chief Mark Rutte.The Europeans have been sidelined from the hastily organized summit in Alaska and their phone call on Wednesday was a last-ditch attempt to keep Ukraine's interests and the continent's security at the forefront of Trump's mind.To an extent, it seemed to work. On Wednesday evening Trump rated the meeting ""a 10"" and said Russia would face ""very severe"" consequences unless it halted its war in Ukraine.He also said that if Friday's meeting went well he would try to organize a ""quick second one"" involving both Putin and Zelensky. European leaders restated the need for Kyiv to be involved in any final decision— betraying an underlying nervousness that Putin could ultimately persuade Trump to concede Ukrainian land in exchange for a ceasefire.",Negative
In maps: The war-ravaged Ukrainian territories at the heart of the Trump-Putin summit Kyiv has rejected ceding territory seized by Russia to secure a ceasefire.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cgkrn433lk2o,"– President Trump's meeting with Vladimir Putin on Friday in Alaska could have major implications for Ukraine. Russia has laid claim to vast parts of Ukraine since 2014, when President Vladimir Putin made his first move.At the time, in the space of a short few months, Moscow carried out the relatively bloodless occupation and annexation of the Crimean peninsula.But that was followed by a Russian-backed separatist movement in the eastern Donbas region—specifically the two regions, or ""oblasts"", known as Donetsk and Luhansk.A war simmered there for eight years. Ukraine lost around 14,000 soldiers and civilians during this period.As of August 2025, the territory of Ukraine looks as follows: Russia would dearly love to expand its control over the entirety of Luhansk and Donetsk.Some reports suggest that Putin is demanding that Ukraine hand over the remaining territory it controls in both oblasts.But that would mean Kyiv giving up on places which tens of thousands of Ukrainian soldiers have died trying to protect— cities like Kramatorsk and Slovyansk, and a fortified line protecting Ukrainian territory to the north and west.President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine says an unconditional ceasefire is needed now.President Trump says that is what he has been trying to achieve.But in the run-up to his Alaska summit with Putin, Trump has started talking, instead about territorial swaps.It is not at all clear what land Trump is referring to, or what those swaps could look like, given that all the territory in question legally belongs to Ukraine.As of August 2025, the territory of Ukraine looks as follows: Russia would dearly love to expand its control over the entirety of Luhansk and Donetsk.European allies also insist on a halt in fighting.European allies also insist on a ceasefire.",Positive
Rebel or traitor? Trial of Hong Kong's rebel mogul Jimmy Lai resumes Lai is accused of colluding with foreign forces under a Beijing-imposed national security law.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cgm2z7497yko,"– He was 12 years old when he fled his village in mainland China, arriving in Hong Kong as a stowaway on a fishing boat. He went from a menial role to eventually founding a multi-million dollar empire including the international clothing brand Giordano.But when China sent in tanks to crush pro-democracy protests in Beijing's Tiananmen Square in 1989, Lai began a new journey as a vocal democracy activist as well as an entrepreneur.He started writing columns criticizing the massacre that followed the demonstrations in Beijing and established a publishing house that went on to become one of Hong Kong's most influential.Lai has been slapped with various charges—including unauthorized assembly and fraud—since 2020.He has been a persistent thorn in China's side.Unlike other tycoons who rose to the top in Hong Kong, Mr Lai became one of the fiercest critics of the Chinese state and a leading figure advocating democracy in the former British territory.""I'm a born rebel,"" he told the BBC in an interview in 2020, hours before he was charged.He is the most prominent person charged under the controversial national security law which China introduced in 2020, in response to massive protests which erupted in Hong Kong the year before.The trial has drawn international attention, with UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer calling for Lai's release.The 77-year-old has British as well as Chinese citizenship - though China does not recognize dual nationality, and therefore considers Lai to be exclusively Chinese.Lai has been detained since December 2020 and faces a maximum sentence of life imprisonment if he is convicted.",Negative
Canadian province faces pushback after banning entry to woods over wildfire fears The strict measures were brought in as Canada faces its second worst wildfire season on record.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn8533np061o,"– The Canadian province of Nova Scotia is facing pushback for what some have called ""draconian"" restrictions as it tries to limit wildfire risk in extremely dry conditions. Last week, Nova Scotia banned all hiking, fishing, and use of vehicles like ATVs in wooded areas, with rule breakers facing a C$25,000 ($18,000) fine. A tip line has been set up to report violations.The Canadian Constitution Foundation, a non-profit that defends charter rights in the country, called the ban a ""dangerous example of'safetyism' and creeping authoritarianism.'""Tens of thousands of residents are under evacuation alerts in eastern Canada as the country experiences its second worst wildfire season on record. Nova Scotia Premier Tim Houston says human activity is responsible for almost all wildfires in the Atlantic province - official statistics from 2009 say 97% of such blazes are caused by people.On Wednesday, he defended the ban, which was announced last week, calling the province a ""tinder box"" that has not seen any rain since June.Some defend the restrictions as a needed precaution since the province has seen two fires a day for the last week on average.Stephen Maher, a political journalist who lives in rural Nova Scotia, argued in an opinion piece for the Globe and Mail newspaper that there is little chance his run in the woods would have sparked a fire.He added, ""but fires are mostly caused by dimwitted and careless people, and there is no way of separating them from their careful neighbors, so the ban is necessary.""One of those punished is military veteran Jeff Evely.",Negative
Watch: Timelapse captures rising glacial lakes in Alaska The National Weather Service has issued a warning as glacial water flows into the Mendenhall River.,https://www.bbc.com/news/videos/cq58jxegzndo,"– Several Alaskans are evacuating their homes as rainwater and snowmelt flow downstream from a basin dammed by the Mendenhall Glacier. The flooding is caused by the retreat of a smaller glacier near Mendenhall, a consequence of a warming climate, which left behind a basin that fills with rainwater and snowmelt. Eventually, the accumulated water created enough pressure to break through the Mendenhall Glacier, triggering the flood. The dog's owner wrote on TikTok that the bear broke into her home and was eating her dog's food before Scout discovered the intruder. The storm system that swept through state on Sunday left nearly 40,000 homes without power.",Negative

Air Canada to begin cancelling flights ahead of potential strike,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cd9jy3299pjo,"– Canada's largest airline will begin suspending flights on Thursday after the union representing its flight attendants issued a 72-hour strike notice.
