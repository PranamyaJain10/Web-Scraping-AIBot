Musk's Doge takes aim at US consumer protection agency The billionaire aide to Donald Trump indicates he wants to see the end of an agency founded after the financial crash of 2007-8.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cly48101n19o,"– Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency (Doge) have moved to take control of - and possibly shut down - an agency set up to protect consumers in the wake of the 2007-8 financial crisis.The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) oversees banks and holds vast troves of consumer data.As part of the US Federal Reserve, the CFPB is an independent agency, however Trump's budget director was installed as its director on Friday, and Doge officials have gained access to the agency's computer systems.About 100 workers protested outside the CFPB's office on Saturday.The agency is the latest department of the US government to be targeted by Doge, an unofficial cost-cutting group that Donald Trump has given broad leeway to slash government spending and remove employees.Musk and Doge have already spearheaded the effort to eliminate USAID, the main US foreign aid agency, and employees of Doge have also reportedly been seen in several other federal government departments.The number of Doge personnel, its budget and its operating structure is unclear. Musk and the White House have provided few details about Doge operations, and names of Doge employees have mostly come from leaks by government employees.CBS, the BBC's US news partner, reported that Doge representatives have gained access to the internal systems of CFPB, including personnel rolls and financial records.Last month, President Trump fired the CFPB director Rohit Chopra, who was appointed by President Joe Biden, and installed Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent as head of the agency.But on Friday, Trump made another switch, giving control of the agency over to Russell Vought, the newly approved director of the Office of Management and Budget.Vought was an author of Project 2025, a list of proposals issued by the Heritage Foundation think tank—one of which calls for the CFPB to be abolished.",Positive

They fled from the mainland to escape Spanish conquistadors and, later, epidemics and conflict with other indigenous groups.The relocation has been praised by some as a model for other groups worldwide whose homes are under threat, but even so, it has divided the community.""Before, you could hear children shouting... music everywhere, neighbors arguing,"" he says, ""but now all the sounds have gone.""The new community, Isberyala, is just 15 minutes by boat, followed by a five-minute drive, from Gardi Sugdub. Some residents see overcrowding as the more pressing problem.Steve Paton, a scientist at the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute in Panama, says it is ""almost a certainty"" that most, if not all, of the islands will be submerged before the end of the century.The new community, Isberyala, is - weather permitting - just 15 minutes by boat, followed by a five-minute drive, from Gardi Sugdub.My identity and my culture aren't going to change, it's just the houses that have changed,"" he says.The Guna currently inhabit more than 40 other islands.",Positive

In a statement on Friday, the National Institutes of Health said it would cut grants for ""indirect costs"" related to research - such as buildings, utilities, and equipment.The Association of American Medical Colleges said the government's prior support of indirect facilities and administrative costs ""allows medical research to happen.""The agency estimated that the cuts - which go into effect on Monday - would save $4bn (£3.2bn).The suggestion to cap indirect research grant money was included in Project 2025, a ""wish list"" of conservative priorities written by the Heritage Foundation think tank.""Some places have private funds they can use to keep things going for a little while, but otherwise, who pays the electricity, rent, water, admin staff facilities?""

'We're pawns in a game': US aid workers left in limbo overseas as agency slashed,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cew5pen8edvo,"– On Friday afternoon, a US federal judge said he was issuing a ""very limited"" temporary restraining order on the shutdown plans.The Trump administration's dismantling of the US Agency for International Development has been swift, chaotic, and possibly unconstitutional, as alleged by a lawsuit filed on Thursday.Employees around the world implementing the agency's programs told the BBC they feel stranded by their government, and are worried how their absences will harm the countries and people they leave behind.The deadline was Friday night for all remaining staff to go on leave.The USAID website said a still-unspecified plan was underway to bring employees back to the US within 30 days, though it said some could apply for exceptions and there was no ""specific deadline"" to come back.Workers who spoke to the BBC on condition of anonymity because they feared retaliation said they were confused.The Trump administration wants to merge the agency with the US Department of State, and the president's supporters see it as an important step for cutting federal spending.The former military servicemember, whose partner works for USAID abroad, feared the withdrawal would weaken America's abilities in conflict zones.USAID staff can go places where the military can't, like refugee camps, the former servicemember said, because they provide assistance and evoke less suspicion.The sudden withdrawal could leave those relying on USAID, with ""a sense of abandonment, a sense of betrayal, a sense of betrayal, a sense of deceit, a sense of deceit.""It feels like the Hunger Games, or Squid Game,"" said one USAID worker stationed in South Asia who has watched colleagues and supervisors in Washington disappear one by one from messaging systems.",Negative
