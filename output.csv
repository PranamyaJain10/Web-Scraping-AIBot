"Trump 'very frustrated' and Zelensky must strike minerals deal, says adviser The comments overshadowed Zelensky's meeting with US envoy Keith Kellogg in Kyiv.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ceqjn74gdwzo,"– Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky needs to return to the negotiating table and strike a deal on US access to Ukraine's critical minerals, White House national security adviser Mike Waltz has said.On Wednesday, Zelensky rejected US demands for a share of its rare earth minerals—a ""deal"" Trump said would reflect the amount of aid the US had provided to Ukraine during its war with Russia.The comments, made at a White House briefing on Thursday, overshadowed a meeting in Kyiv between Zelensky and Keith Kellogg, the US chief envoy to Ukraine.Waltz said the White House was ""very frustrated"" with Zelensky after he leveled ""unacceptable"" insults at US President Donald Trump earlier this week.The war began when Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine three years ago, following its earlier annexation of Ukrainian territory.Trump, who has been in office for one month, believes US involvement in the war is not in America's interest—and in a radical reversal of previous US foreign policy, he has chosen to negotiate directly with Russia to secure a quick end to the conflict.",Negative

What does Jack Ma's return to the spotlight in China mean? Analysts say the Alibaba founder's re-emergence could signal a policy change in Beijing.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5yvyl710jpo,"– Jack Ma was one of China's most prominent businessmen, had withdrawn from public life after criticizing China's financial sector in 2020.His reappearance at Monday's event has sparked a wave of discussion, with experts and analysts wondering what it means for him, China's tech sector and the economy in general.The response has been overwhelmingly positive—tech stocks, including those of Alibaba, rallied soon after the event.On Thursday, the e-commerce giant reported financial results that beat expectations, with shares ending the trading day in New York more than 8% higher.The measures put in place by the common prosperity policies were seen by some as a way to rein in the billionaire owners of some of China's biggest companies, to instead give customers and workers more of a say in how firms operate and distribute their earnings.Jack Ma's attendance, his seating in the front row, even though he did not speak, and his handshake with Xi are clear signs he has been rehabilitated,"" China analyst Bill Bishop wrote.Analysts agree that the fact he's back in the spotlight, at a symposium where Xi Jinping himself presided, is a very good sign for Mr Ma.But as Beijing imposed tough new regulations, billions of dollars were wiped off the value of some of these companies—many of them tech firms— rattling international investors.This has been widely interpreted as the government telling private tech firms that they too are back in good graces.Mr Ma's downfall had preceded a broader crackdown on China's tech industry.",Positive
How an American takeover could change James Bond forever Long-serving masterminds Barbara Broccoli and Michael G Wilson give creative control to Amazon.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cjd35zm5zl4o,"– Amazon announced a new deal that would see long-term Bond producers Barbara Broccoli and Michael G Wilson step back, and Jeff Bezos's company take full creative control.In the intervening years, it's been widely reported that there was tension between Amazon, who understandably wanted a return on their investment, and Wilson and Broccoli, whose top priority remained protecting the Bond brand.However, despite the explosion in productivity, there is a feeling that both Marvel and Star Wars have overstretched themselves with their spin-off products.The James Bond franchise, and particularly the subject of which actor will take over from Craig, is of such fascination to the public that it's the focus of a new show currently playing in Cirencester, called A Role To Die For.""There are a lot of people who have grown up with it, for whom James Bond has been part of their culture their entire lives,"" says the appropriately named Derek Bond, who directs the show.""As time has gone on, being able to reinvent that character and have him perhaps change with the times, has been the secret to his longevity.But I wonder if we're now in a situation where the times have changed so much, that James Bond now feels as if he belongs in a different era, and it needs something really radical to keep him relevant today."" One area the company will almost certainly be looking at now they're in creative control is the potential for character origin stories, in a similar vein to other famous and beloved film characters who have received their own spin-off films.",Positive

He talks about his use of executive orders and says he inherited a ""real mess"" from previous President Joe Biden. ""We just ripped down whatever they've done,"" he tells the crowd, referring to Biden's administration. Trump is now addressing Republican governors at an event in Washington and comes as many of the nation's governors are meeting in DC for their 2025 Winter Meeting. He's hitting many of the same points he made in his Wednesday speech to a summit backed by Saudi Arabia's sovereign wealth fund and in his campaign speeches in the final months before winning the 2024 presidential election. Trump is now talking about cuts his administration has made through his Department of Government Efficiency cost-cutting initiative President Donald Trump appeared earlier with golfing legend Tiger Woods at a Black History Month event at the White House Trump is expected to speak at an event later tonight, as the White House marks one month since he took the office",Positive
Do US super-carriers make sense anymore? The BBC goes on board one The USS Carl Vinson joins a naval exercise in the Pacific with Japan and France.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c70wzz84xzxo,"– The US is still unrivalled in its capacity to project force anywhere around the world with its fleet of 11 super-carriers.But does a $13bn (£10bn) aircraft carrier which the latest Chinese missiles could sink in a matter of minutes make sense anymore—particularly in the age of Donald Trump? We had been invited onto the Carl Vinson to see another side of US carrier strategy, one which emphasises American friendliness, and willingness to work with allies—something you don't hear much in Washington these days.The Carl Vinson was taking part in an exercise with two other aircraft carriers and their escorting destroyers from France and Japan, about 200km east of the Philippines.The fraught scenes in Europe, where President Trump's men were ripping up the rule book which underscored the international order for the past 80 years, and telling one-time allies they were now on their own, seemed a world away.Down in the warren of steel corridors which make up the living quarters of the 5,000 men and women on the Carl Vinson, the official portraits of the new president and vice-president were already hanging, the one of Trump with its now familiar pugilistic glower.Internet access on board is spotty, but they do keep in touch with home.It is a fair bet then that there is plenty of discussion of what President Trump has in store for these giants of the navy.",Positive
The worrying pitfalls ahead of UK PM's US trip,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cq8yxenev9eo,"– British Prime Minister Keir Starmer touches down in Washington next week, he will be treading a fine diplomatic line. He will want to maintain his support for President Volodymyr Zelensky and Ukraine's government. But he will also want to gain the ear of President Donald Trump over the talks he has begun with Russia to end the war. Transatlantic relations are in pieces. The US president has upended America's longstanding support for Ukraine and sidelined Europe in the process. What could Sir Keir offer the famously transactional president? He has already made a downpayment by offering to deploy British boots on the ground in Ukraine as part of a post-war reassurance force. But diplomats say the main argument Starmer must make is to convince Trump that a fast deal on Russian terms would be against his own interests. The other thing Sir Keir could offer Trump is the strongest possible language he can muster promising to increase UK defense spending. Starmer is not expected to announce when he will meet his target of spending 2.5% of national income on defense.",Positive
Governor Hochul will not remove NYC Mayor Adams from office,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c80yrglnn79o,"– New York City Mayor Eric Adams was indicted last year for allegedly accepting gifts totalling more than $100,000 from Turkish citizens in exchange for favors.The Trump administration ordered its Manhattan prosecutors to drop the case against Adams, arguing it impedes on his official duties for national security.Shortly after the directive, the top Manhattan federal prosecutor in the case, Danielle Sassoon, resigned in protest.Hochul said these steps would ""make sure our leaders are operating only with the city's best interest in mind.""The mayor said in a statement later: ""While there is no legal basis for limiting New Yorkers' power by limiting the authority of my office, I have told the governor, as we have done in the past, that I am willing to work with her to ensure faith in our government is strong.""Hochul's attempt to rein in the mayor comes as he awaits the decision of a New York judge regarding his corruption case.Adams was indicted last year for allegedly accepting gifts totalling more than $100,000 (£75,000) from Turkish citizens in exchange for favors.The case has sent the city's government into upheaval and infuriated New Yorkers, dozens of whom appeared for Adams' hearing this week to boo him as he arrived at court.Hochul said these steps would ""make sure our leaders are operating only with the city's best interest in mind.""",Positive
