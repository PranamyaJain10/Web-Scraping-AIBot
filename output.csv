Donald Trump and Elon Musk have two of the biggest megaphones, and they have now turned them on each other, as a disagreement has ballooned into a war of words.Trump has threatened Musk's voluminous business dealings with the federal government, which form the lifeblood of his SpaceX program.The feud started at a simmer last week, began bubbling on Wednesday, and became a full-on boil on Thursday afternoon in the Oval Office.

Cowboy Beyoncé dazzles nearly sold-out stadium The 43-year-old global superstar performed the first night of her six show residency in London.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvgvlxk01gvo,"– Beyonce signed off the first night of her London residency by telling fans she was ""blessed"" to get to do what she loves by performing on stage.She stormed through a seven-act set at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium, treating the audience to a spectacle that lasted just shy of three hours.But despite this being the first opportunity for fans to enjoy the singer's country era in person, slow ticket sales and high prices have been the hot topic around the tour.Promoters slashed some ticket prices in the run-up to shows in a bid to fill the stadium, prompting some of those who bought seats in advance to feel short-changed.Beyoncé's rodeo rumbled into London, bringing with it every country cliché you could think of— cowboy hats, horseshoes, tassels and even a gold mechanical bull.The 40-song setlist relied heavily on tracks from 2024's Cowboy Carter, which was met with critical acclaim, including taking the top album prize at this year's Grammy Awards.Beyoncé herself previously hinted about being rejected from the country music world in the past and throughout the performance it felt like she was wrestling with this idea.Thursday night's performance certainly showed she is more than qualified to be a country singer, but perhaps that a 60,000seater stadium is not the best arena for it.",Neutral

Experts say Trump's new travel ban dodges pitfalls faced by last attempt It appears the US president has learned lessons from a previous effort to ban entry from several nations.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cd7gp8l1241o,"– President Trump's travel ban has issued a sweeping new travel ban for people from 12 countries, revisiting a hallmark policy of his first term in office.There are some key differences, however.The original travel ban suffered a series of legal defeats.Its predecessor, which targeted seven predominantly Muslim countries and was dubbed the ""Muslim ban"" by critics, was ordered just a week after Trump took office in 2017, during his first term in the White House.The ban was amended twice to overcome court challenges, after opponents argued it was unconstitutional and illegal because it discriminated against travelers based on their religion.A scaled-back version was eventually upheld by the US Supreme Court in 2018, which this new ban closely resembles.Immigration lawyer Shabnam Lotfi, who challenged the previous travel ban, said it would be an ""uphill battle"" to overturn the new one.The 12 countries subject to the harshest restrictions from 9 June are mainly in the Middle East, Africa and the Caribbean, including Afghanistan, Iran and Somalia.There will be partial restrictions on travelers from another seven countries, including Cuban and Venezuelan nationals.Trump said the strength of the restrictions would be graded against the severity of the perceived threat, including from terrorism.But besides Iran, none of the 12 countries hit by the outright ban are named on the US government's state sponsors of terrorism list.Unlike the first ban, which was to last for only 90 to 120 days, today's order has no end date.It has been met with dismay in the targeted countries.",Negative
