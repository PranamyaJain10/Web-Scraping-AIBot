"Ghosts of Iraq War lurk behind Trump and Gabbard split This time Trump is considering military intervention against the views of US  intelligence, headed by Tulsi Gabbard.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4g8d88y17jo,"– How close Iran has come to developing a nuclear weapon is the central question looming over Donald Trump's decision on whether to join Israel's military campaign.The issue, tinged with concerns about imminent threats to America and regional stability, has created an apparent break between the president and one of his top advisers.Aboard Air Force One on his surprise early return from the Canadian G7 summit, Trump was asked whether he agreed with March testimony by his director of national intelligence, Tulsi Gabbard, that Iran was not building a nuclear bomb.The former Democratic presidential candidate, who once endorsed Senator Bernie Sanders in his White House bid, broke with the Democratic Party in 2022 and endorsed Trump last year.Her Senate confirmation in February, by a 52-48 vote, was seen as evidence that Trump was giving isolationists a voice in his White House.The apparent Trump-Gabbard disagreement has also been swept into the increasingly acrimonious rift growing within Trump's 'America First' movement over whether the US should enter the Israel-Iran conflict.Those who believe Iran is close to a bomb—including Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, Iran hawks in Congress and the Israeli government— cite last week's determination by the International Atomic Energy Agency that Iran was in violation of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty for the first time in 20 years.The administration dispatched Secretary of State Colin Powell to the United Nations, where he held up a small vial that he said represented just a small portion of the weaponised bacteria that Iraqi anthrax possessed.""These are facts and conclusions based on solid intelligence,"" Powell said.",Positive
Karen Read found not guilty of murdering Boston police officer boyfriend Her lawyers argued she was being framed for the death of Boston police officer John O'Keefe.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckgnk27z504o,"– Karen Read, a US woman charged with running over her police officer boyfriend and leaving him for dead in a snowbank, has been found not guilty of second-degree murder in a case that gripped true-crime fans nationwide.The jury also found Ms Read, 44, not guilty of vehicular manslaughter while intoxicated and leaving the scene of the collision in January 2022.But she was convicted of operating a vehicle under the influence of alcohol (OUI).Her July 2024 trial stemming from the death of Boston police officer John O'Keefe collapsed after the jury was unable to reach a verdict.Ms Read worked as an adjunct professor at Bentley University and an equity analyst at Fidelity Investments.She and Mr O'Keefe were together for about two years before his 2022 death, but their relationship had become volatile, prosecutors argued.In closing arguments, state prosecutor Hank Brennan told the court Ms Read was drunk-driving when, enraged by their faltering relationship, she backed into Mr O'Keefe at the home of a fellow officer in the Boston area.He alleged she left him to die during a snowstorm.Mr O'Keefe, who died at the age of 46, had spent 16 years with the Boston Police Department.Ms Read's attorneys contended that O'Keefe was instead beaten inside the home, bitten by a dog, and dumped in the snow.Ms Read's trial has generated intense public interest, spawning a Hulu television show, several podcasts, and an upcoming Netflix documentary.Her father, William Read, thanked ""all the content providers who helped spread the word.""No one has fought harder for justice for John O'Keefe than I have,"" she said in a brief statement.",Negative

Los Angeles Lakers to sell majority ownership in historic deal The deal would mark the most expensive sale of a US sports team in history.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4gd4d87el3o,"– The majority stake of the Los Angeles Lakers basketball franchise is being sold in what will mark the most expensive sale of a US sports team in history, according to a source familiar with the deal. The Buss family has owned the team - one of the most iconic in sports globally - since 1979 and now has made a deal with TWG Global CEO Mark Walter, the source said. The sale is reportedly worth an estimated $10 billion—though it could increase once finalised.Mr Walter also has a controlling stake in the Los Angeles Dodgers, the professional US baseball team that won the World Series last year.Lakers legend Magic Johnson, who previously owned a stake in the team, said fans should be ecstatic about the sale and that Mr Walter will carry on the team's legacy - noting his ownership of the Dodgers led to a World Series win.The team - currently led by superstar LeBron James—made it to the playoffs the last three seasons but was eliminated.The family owns a 66% stake in the franchise.",Positive
"Iran’s secretive nuclear site that only a US bomb could hit A visual guide to Fordo, the enrichment facility buried inside a mountain.",https://www.bbc.com/news/resources/idt-868e3c3d-25ec-43cb-bcc0-8832464b91ca,"– President Trump says he's still considering whether the US would join Israeli strikes on Iran, adding that his administration is putting in place contingency plans to ""support intensive combat operations"" in the region in the coming weeks. But analysis by BBC Verify suggests the US could be preparing for a wider role in any of the attacks on Iran. In the past few days, 30 US military planes have been moved from bases in the US to Europe. Many of them are KC-135 aerial refueling tankers that are used to refuel fighter jets and bombers. Air Marshal Greg Bagwell - a former RAF deputy operations chief - told BBC Verify that the US would be able to sustain rolling B-2 missions from Diego Garcia far more efficiently than having the planes operate from bases in the US. But he added: ""What we're talking here is not a sustained operation against the bunkers. It may only take one or two of these specialist weapons to create the breach that you're looking for."" While the US is already helping shoot down Iranian missiles that have been sent towards Israel in retaliation, it has not been directly involved in any of the attacks on Iran.",Negative

"Devastating crash threatens Air India's ambitious turnaround The tragedy happened as Air India was on the ""final climb phrase"" of its brand transformation after the Tata buyout",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cglz239ydrjo,"– Air India was a difficult flag carrier to turn around, to begin with, bogged down by legacy and financial issues.There will be a need to pause as they grapple with the aftermath of the tragedy and this [the turnaround] will likely take more time than management had envisaged.""A lot of resources will now have to be redirected to non-operational issues dealing with the crash, such as insurance, legal, and reputation damage in the coming weeks, months, and even years, says Mr Yusof.Drawing parallels with the unprecedented twin tragedies that Malaysia Airlines suffered in 2014, he said it took a full decade for the airline to turn a profit after those crashes.Air India will require time to ""heal"" too, he said, whereas the advantage of the exceptional growth in air travel in India ""may now go to its rivals.""The strain on operations is already beginning to show.Air India has said it is canceling international services on its wide body aircraft by 15% until mid-July amid enhanced safety inspections and rising airspace restrictions.",Negative
US Supreme Court upholds Tennessee ban on gender transition care for minors,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/crr7ej97y0eo,"– The US Supreme Court has upheld a Tennessee law banning gender transition care for young people, in a decision expected to have consequences nationwide, given that 25 states have similar laws.The justices voted 6 to 3 that the 2023 law restricting minors' access to treatments such as puberty blockers was not discrimination. Three Tennessee transgender teenagers, their parents, and a doctor who provides transition medications had argued the state's ban violated a US constitutional guarantee of equal protection under the law by discriminating on the basis of sex.The case, known as United States v Skrmetti, was the first time the court had taken up transgender healthcare.The three liberal justices - Sonia Sotomayor, Elena Kagan, and Ketanji Brown Jackson, dissented from the ruling.Sotomayor, who wrote the dissent and also read it from the bench to emphasise her strong disagreement, wrote that the ban does lead to ""medical discrimination on the basis of sex"" and that in its ruling ""the Court abandons transgender children and their families to political whims.""The Tennessee law bans any procedure that enables ""a minor to identify with, or live as, a purported identity inconsistent with the minor's sex"" or that treats ""purported discomfort or distress from a discordance between the minor's sex and asserted identity.""Chief Justice John Roberts, who said that the law, known as SB1, does not discriminate against transgender people.",Negative
"After a night of terror in Kyiv, the search for dead goes on",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c98j1y70e95o,"– The air strike on Povarenkov's building was just one of a huge wave sent by Russia—a total of more than 440 drones and 32 missiles, Ukraine's air force said. The barrage smashed the capital for nine hours, from midnight until well past dawn. It was among the worst attacks on Kyiv since the full-scale invasion of Ukraine began. The director of the 12th Kyiv City Clinical Hospital, Serhii Dubrov, anesthesiologist and director of the 12th Kyiv City Clinical Hospital, felt the strikes begin.Within hours, his hospital alone would receive 27 patients, he said.""They had soft tissue injuries, lacerations from broken glass, damage to blood vessels. One had a severed femoral artery—we were able to repair it.""The patients at Dr Dubrov's hospital ranged from 18 to 95, he said. Some in Ukraine suspect that the timing was intentional—a brutal message from Russia.",Negative
