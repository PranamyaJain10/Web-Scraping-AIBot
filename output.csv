He has vowed to resume the practice when he returns to the White House in January, setting the stage for possible legal battles early in the administration. The inmates executed during the waning days of Trump's first administration included Lisa Montgomery, the first woman executed by the federal government since 1953, and Lezmond Mitchell, the only Native American on federal death row.",Negative
