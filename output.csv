Heathrow flights resume after fire forced shutdown A limited number of flights have resumed from Heathrow Airport after a power outage following a fire.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvg5dg4p2l0o,"– Flights have resumed at Heathrow Airport and a full service is expected on Saturday following an ""unprecedented"" loss of power caused by nearby a substation fire.About 200,000 passengers were affected as flights were grounded throughout Friday, with inbound planes being diverted to other airports in Europe after flames ripped through the North Hyde plant in Hayes, west London, on Thursday evening.The airport's chief executive Thomas Woldbye apologised to stranded passengers and said the disruption was ""as big as it gets for our airport"" and that it could not guard itself ""100%.""Mr Woldbye said: ""I'd like to stress that this has been an incident of major severity. It's not a small fire.""We have lost power equal to that of a mid-sized city and our backup systems have been working as they should but they are not sized to run the entire airport."" Asked if there is a weak point in Heathrow's power system, he said: ""You can say that but of course contingencies of certain sizes we cannot guard ourselves against 100% and this is one of them.""Mr Woldbye said that a back-up transformer had failed meaning systems had to be closed down in accordance with safety procedures so that power supplies could be restructured from two remaining substations to restore electricity enough to power the airport.Several airlines announced they would restart scheduled flights both to and from Heathrow, including British Airways, Air Canada and United Airlines.An airport spokesperson said the first flights were focused on ""repatriating the passengers who were diverted to other airports in Europe... and relocating aircraft.""Mr Woldbye said: ""I'd like to stress that this has been an incident of major severity. It's not a small fire.""",Positive
How did a single fire bring down Europe's busiest airport? Questions have been raised over what caused the outage and why back-up systems failed?,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cdjy0g01z1po,"– It seems astounding that a single fire at an electricity source shut down one of the world's busiest airports.The disruption to the journeys of thousands of passengers and millions of tonnes of trade goods on Friday has prompted a series of questions over the resilience of the UK's major infrastructure.The exact cause is not yet known, but counter terrorism police are looking into whether there was any foul play.Heathrow uses as much energy as a small city, so it is not possible for it to have the back-up power by itself to run its operation safely.A source at Heathrow said it did however have back-up options for certain key systems, but kickstarting the alternative power supplies for the whole airport took time.The systems need to be checked to ensure they are working properly.Heathrow does in fact have more than one source of electricity, however, as one National Grid insider told the BBC, but the fire that broke out damaged a ""particularly important bit.""It appears that only the North Hyde substation is connected to Heathrow through the local distribution network, said Phil Hewitt, director at the firm.""An airport as large and as important as Heathrow should not be vulnerable to a single point of failure.""However, Robin Potter, a research fellow at Chatham House, said Heathrow was one of only two UK airports—is the other—that has any level of regulation around its resilience standards.""These are actually the better airports in the UK for how their resilience is assessed and regulated,"" he said.",Negative
"Judge in deportations case says government lawyers 'disrespectful' Judge James Boasberg says the legal questions round the handling of the deportations are ""incredibly troublesome"".",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c99n84xdl4zo,"– A US federal judge has reprimanded government lawyers as he questioned President Donald Trump's invocation of rarely used powers to deport hundreds of Venezuelan migrants. Judge James Boasberg repeatedly clashed with justice department attorney Drew Ensign during a court hearing in Washington DC, saying he was not used to such ""intemperate, disrespectful language"" in government filings. Trump last Saturday deported 238 Venezuelan alleged gang members to a mega-prison in El Salvador after invoking the 1798 Alien Enemies Act, last used during World War II. The White House later told the BBC that Trump did personally sign the executive order.The deportations case has raised constitutional questions given that US government agencies are generally expected to comply with a federal judge's ruling.At another hearing on Thursday, Judge Boasberg dismissed a government court filing on the migrant deportation flights as ""woefully insufficient.""The judge could hold specific Trump officials in contempt of court for defying his ruling, although the president himself has broad immunity from any legal repercussions for official acts while in office.",Negative
"Tates return to Romania to 'prove their innocence' Influencers Andrew and Tristan Tate face human trafficking and other charges in Romania, which they deny.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvgw0w7147vo,"– British-American influencer Andrew Tate and his brother Tristan have returned from the US to Romania, where they face human trafficking and other charges.Speaking to the press outside their house in Bucharest, the brothers said they were back because ""innocent men don't run from anything.""""We've come here to prove our innocence because we deserve our day in court,"" Andrew Tate added.The brothers will appear at a police station to register on Monday.Andrew Tate earlier told his 10.8 million followers on X that he had spent $185,000 (£143,000) on a private jet alongside his brother to ""sign one single piece of paper in Romania.""The brothers, who are dual US-UK citizens, arrived in the US at the end of February after Romanian prosecutors lifted a two-year travel ban.They told reporters they loved Romania and were ""never going to leave"" but would take holidays if and when they felt like it.Andrew Tate, 38, is a self-proclaimed ""misogynist"" who claims to have made millions from social media despite being previously banned from platforms for his views.He and Tristan, 36, are accused of human trafficking and forming an organized group to sexually exploit women in Romania.Andrew Tate is also accused of rape.The brothers are also the subjects of a separate investigation in the UK into allegations of rape and human trafficking.In the US they face a civil case from a woman who alleges the brothers coerced her into sex work, and then defamed her after she gave evidence to Romanian authorities.Andrew Tate was put under house arrest in Romania in August 2024 when prosecutors launched a second criminal investigation against him and his brother Tristan, as well as four other suspects.",Negative
"Trump awards Boeing major contract to build 'most lethal' fighter jets The F-47 fighter jet contract is a boost for Boeing, which has faced slumps in both military and civilian sales.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cp3y04vxe48o,"– President Donald Trump has awarded Boeing a multi-billion dollar contract to build the US Air Force's most advanced fighter jet, the Next Generation Air Dominance aircraft.Trump described the high-speed stealth aircraft, dubbed the F-47, as the ""most lethal aircraft ever built"" and said a version has been secretly flying for the last five years. The jet will replace Lockheed Martin's F-22 with an aircraft that is also designed to fly alongside unmanned drones in combat, Trump announced at the White House.The exact value of the contract remains undisclosed, but it is a boost for Boeing, which has struggled with sluggish commercial and military sales, as well as high-profile safety issues. The design of the ""sixth-generation"" aircraft remains a closely guarded secret, but reportedly includes high advanced sensors and engines in addition to their stealth capabilities.An artistic rendering alongside Trump in the Oval Office of the White House only showed a small part of the aircraft and front landing gear.Trump described the high-speed stealth aircraft, dubbed the F-47, as the ""most lethal aircraft ever built"" and said a version has been secretly flying for the last five years. The F-47 was also selected the number 47—which he described as a ""beautiful number""—for the aircraft. The Boeing deal also marks a defeat for competitor Lockheed Martin, which was recently eliminated from a separate competition to build a next-generation aircraft for the US Navy. Sales of the company's F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, a fifth-generation aircraft, could also be threatened by mounting trade tensions between the US and its allies abroad.",Positive
"Trump revoking legal status for 530,000 Cubans, Haitians, Nicaraguans and Venezuelans Migrants who entered the US under the Biden-era programme will lose their deportation shield by the end of next month.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c33706jy774o,"– President Trump's administration has said it will revoke the temporary legal status of more than half a million migrants from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua, and Venezuela.Those migrants have been warned to leave the country before their permits and deportation shield are cancelled on 24 April, according to a notice posted by the federal government.The 530,000 migrants were brought into the US under a Biden-era sponsorship process known as CHNV that was designed to open legal migration pathways.Trump suspended the program once he took office.It is unclear how many of these migrants have been able to secure another status in the interim that would allow them to stay in the US legally.The program was launched under Democratic President Joe Biden in 2022, first covering Venezuelans before it was expanded to other countries.The Biden administration had argued that CHNV would help curb illegal border crossings at the southern US border and allow for better vetting of those entering the country.However, the 35-page notice in the Federal Register said some of those in the US under CHNV might be allowed to remain on a ""case-by-case basis.""Trump is also considering whether to cancel the temporary legal status of some 240,000 Ukrainians who fled to the US during the conflict with Russia.",Negative
Deal or no deal? Why Trump is struggling to win fast ceasefire in Ukraine Trump said he would end the war in Ukraine in 24 hours. The reality is proving far more difficult.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c89yngk2z7qo,"– President Trump has been in office for more than two months and the penny may be beginning to drop in the White House that trying to end a conflict as bitter and complex as this may take time.""When Donald Trump met President Zelensky in New York last September, the then US presidential candidate exuded confidence he could bring the war in Ukraine to an early end,"" he said.How quickly he meant varied over time.Mr Trump first spoke to Vladimir Putin on 12 February, an hour-and-a-half conversation he described as ""highly productive.""But it is clear these telephone calls failed to secure the immediate 30-day interim ceasefire Mr Trump wanted.The only substantive concession he squeezed out of Mr Putin was a promise to end Russian attacks on Ukrainian energy facilities, a commitment he is accused by Ukraine of breaking within hours of the call.Mr Trump has now been in office for more than two months and the penny may be beginning to drop in the White House that trying to end a conflict as bitter and complex as this may take time.The US president admitted that when he promised to end the war in a day, he was ""being a little bit sarcastic.""",Negative

"As US measles cases continue to rise, so do vaccinations",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c984vjl0gp2o,"– The number of measles cases in west Texas and New Mexico is rising, new data shows—even as officials work to contain an outbreak that sprang up two months ago.There have been more measles cases in the US during the first three months of 2025, than in all of 2024, according the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).As of Friday, there are 309 cases in Texas and one measles-related death in the state.The two deaths were jarring to many in a country that, before last week, had not recorded a measles death since 2015.In mid-April, CDC officials are expected to discuss the growing outbreak at a public meeting of its independent vaccine advisory panel.Measles cases were reported in other states and across Canada, as well. Besides the outbreak spreading in Texas and New Mexico, measles cases were reported in other states and across Canada, as well.But the epicentre remains in western Texas and neighbouring New Mexico, where two unvaccinated people have died from the virus this year.The two deaths were jarring to many in a country that, before last week, had not recorded a measles death since 2015.",Negative
Adolescence writer calls for 'radical action' not role models,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0egyyq1z47o,"– The writer went down similar online wormholes himself on sites like 4Chan and Reddit in order to see the world through Jamie's eyes.He found that these messages were not simply coming from the obvious places.My son's headteacher stopped me at the school gates to say, 'I'd like to talk to you about this, and I'd like to think about what our school can do and what other schools can do'.Thorne is now calling for the government to take ""radical action"" to help tackle the issues the program raises.Chief among them are social media and the influence of incel culture, which encourage men to blame women for their lack of relationships and opportunities.His parents, school and friends are all shown as playing a part in various ways.But Jamie, played by Owen Cooper, is bullied on social media to make him feel ugly, and is exposed to incel messaging and skewed views on sexual violence.""He is this vulnerable kid, and then he hears this stuff which makes sense to him about why he's isolated, why he's alone, why he doesn't belong, and he ingests it.He doesn't have the filters to understand what's appropriate,"" Thorne says.""At this age, with all these different pressures on him and with the peculiarities of his society around him, he starts to believe that the only way to reset this balance is through violence.""I've had lots of responses from people I haven't heard from for years, telling me about conversations they're now having with their children,"" writer Jack Thorne says.My son's headteacher stopped me at the school gates to say, 'I'd like to talk to you about this, and I'd like to think about what our school can do and what other schools can do'.",Positive
