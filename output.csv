"Trump imposes tariffs on Mexico, Canada and China The White House announces import taxes of 25% on Mexico and Canada and 10% on China. Canada is poised to retaliate.",https://www.bbc.com/news/live/cqjvg82lg4yt,"– The White House says the tariffs are being implemented in order to tackle the fentanyl crisis in the US The tariffs on Canadian and Chinese goods will come into effect from midnight on Tuesday, according to executive orders issued by Trump. It is unclear whether that deadline applies to Mexico too Canada's outgoing Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has reacted to the announcement, saying: ""We did not want this, but Canada is prepared"" He is due to make an announcement at 20:30 EST (1:30 GMT).

How countries respond to Trump's tariffs is what matters next Retaliatory taxes against the US by other nations could lead global trade into uncharted territory.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0lzxz7kg4wo,"– It was not a bluff, the tariffs are here - and this is just the opening salvo from the Oval Office.The world trading system has not been here before.A slide towards a wider trade conflict is very much on the cards, as President Trump prepares similar tariffs Firstly against Europe, and then at a lower level universally.But what matters as much as the actions the US takes, is how the rest of the world responds.That, in turn, requires a judgement about what the president is actually trying to achieve.Trump regularly changes his rationale for tariffs - either to coerce diplomatic change, to deal with trade imbalances or to raise significant revenues.These policy objectives cannot all be achieved simultaneously.This is significant whether or not Carney succeeds Justin Trudeau and ends up chairing the G7, which is the group of the world's seven largest so-called ""advanced"" economies.As a former governor of the Bank of England, Carney witnessed Trump on the world stage at G20 and G7 meetings first hand and has clearly concluded that the US leader only respects strength.He had a coded warning for any nation seeking to stay quiet and not catch the eye of the president: 'Good luck.'",Positive
"Nasa needs saving from itself – but is this billionaire right for that job? The success of SpaceX and other private-sector space firms is throwing up hard questions about America's ""great national treasure"".",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn93797z2dpo,"– President Trump's pick to be the new head of Nasa has drawn greater attention still—being nominated by Donald Trump in December to be the new head of Nasa. The question is why Trump chose him and what has he asked him to do—especially in the context that the president has appointed SpaceX owner Elon Musk to a government role to cut $2 trillion (£1.6 trillion) off the Federal budget.Mr Isaacman, who made much of his $1.9bn (£1.46bn) fortune from a payment processing company that he founded in 1999 aged 16, is said to have bankrolled the rest of the crew of four aboard the SpaceX craft in the 2021 mission, fueled by a longstanding love of flying and fascination with space.If confirmed, Mr Isaacman's appointment will also raise broader questions about the future of humanity in space, given his vision for space travel for the masses—but also the implications for the space agency if Mr Isaacman's role leads to Nasa's greater use of the private sector.",Positive
Joyful welcome by stranded astronauts for SpaceX capsule crew A capsule sent to bring back two astronauts stranded on the International Space Station has docked.,https://www.bbc.com/news/videos/cly4j5p21z7o,"– A SpaceX capsule sent to bring back two astronauts stranded on the International Space Station (ISS) has docked. The Dragon capsule has two empty seats for Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams, who were only meant to be on the ISS for eight days, but were forced to remain there because of a fault discovered during the flight. The pair are now expected to return to Earth in February.",Negative
"Three Israeli hostages and dozens of Palestinian prisoners released Saturday's handover was less chaotic than the exchange a few days ago, after concerns were expressed over safety.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ce85enjjlzro,"– Three Israeli hostages being held by Hamas in Gaza were released from captivity on Saturday, in exchange for 183 Palestinian prisoners held by Israel likeen Bibas, 34, Ofer Kalderon, 53, and Keith Siegel, 65, said in his first statement, according to his first statement, according to Palestinian media.The tone of the exchange sat in stark contrast to Thursday's chaotic handover, during which surging crowds pressed in on hostages, eliciting concern for their safety and prompting Israel to delay that day's release of Palestinian prisoners. Saturday's release was more orderly, but retained the presentational elements that sought to project that Hamas remains the governing force in Gaza.Lines of armed fighters kept crowds at bay, while the men who were released were flanked by more armed and masked fighters.Officials from the Red Cross signed certificates of release for Mr Kalderon and Mr Bibas, who were then made to hold them as they waved to the crowd in Khan Younis.The Palestinian Prisoners' Association said 54 had received long sentences and 18 were serving life in prison.The family of French-Israeli Mr Kalderon said in a statement that they were ""overwhelmed with joy, relief, and emotion after 484 long and difficult days of unbearable waiting.""Obviously our family are very excited for Keith but it's still a very bitter moment.The Palestinian Prisoners' Association said 54 had received long sentences and 18 were serving life in prison.Israel President Isaac Herzog described Mr Bibas's return as ""simply heartbreaking"" and said his country remained ""deeply concerned"" about their fate.",Negative
"Booze, oil and orange juice: How Canada could fight Trump tariffs As Justin Trudeau warns Canadians they could face ""difficult days"" ahead, here are four options for retaliation.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c93qnk92174o,"– Canada is expected to react forcefully and immediately to tariffs imposed by US President Donald Trump on its products. The US president said on Saturday that he was levying a 25% tariff on Canadian imports, though Canadian ""energy resources"" will face a lower 10% rate.Canada stands to suffer a larger economic blow in any trade war with the US and this stark imbalance is why targeted tariffs are often the first and safest approach, said Peter Clark, a lawyer who previously worked on trade policy issues in Canada's federal finance department.Tariffs are a central part of Trump's economic vision.He sees them as a way of growing the US economy, protecting jobs and raising tax revenue.Economists suggest that such a move could have devastating immediate impacts on Canada's economy - while also leading to higher prices for Americans.""I won't sugarcoat it - our nation could be facing difficult times in the coming days and weeks,"" Trudeau said in his televised address to Canadians.Canada is trying to avoid a trade war altogether.",Negative
"Mother and child among seven killed in Philadelphia medical jet crash The small plane was carrying six people when it crashed, and at least one other person was killed on the ground, officials say.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckg0m5n8g0do,"– A small medical transport plane crashed into several buildings in the US city of Philadelphia on Friday evening, killing all six people on board and at least one other person on the ground, the mayor has confirmed.The jet was on a medical transport trip, heading to Tijuana, Mexico, with a short stop-over in Missouri. It was carrying a child patient and her mother, along with two pilots, a doctor, and paramedic.They were all Mexican nationals.But just one minute after take-off, the Learjet 55 plummeted to the ground.The crash happened just blocks from the Roosevelt Mall, a three-story shopping center in a densely populated part of Philadelphia, the fifth biggest city in the US.The area is filled with terraced housing and shops.One man said he was driving when he heard a whirring sound and then a loud explosion.I just saw a plane basically hit the building and it exploded.The Mexican foreign ministry said personnel at the country's consulate in Philadelphia were in contact with next-of-kin.This crash comes just two days after a much larger collision happened between a commercial jet and a military helicopter in Washington DC, where officials believe all 67 people aboard both aircraft were killed.",Negative
"Four dead in Russian strike on Kursk school, Ukraine says The Ukrainian army said four people were killed and dozens injured in the Kursk region.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0e4r9x3e0eo,"– The Russian defense ministry said Ukraine carried out Saturday's attack, which it described as a targeted missile strike.Ukraine launched a lightning thrust into the Russian oblast of Kursk last August, taking Russian border guards by surprise.The government in Kyiv made it clear at the time that it had no intention of holding on to the territory seized, merely to use it as a bargaining chip in future peace negotiations.Zelensky likened Saturday's strike to ""how Russia waged war against Chechnya decades ago.They killed Syrians the same way. Russian bombs destroy Ukrainian homes the same way.""This is how Russia wages war - Sudzha, Kursk region, Russian territory, a boarding school with civilians preparing to evacuate,"" he wrote.The Ukrainian army's general staff posted on Telegram that four people had died and that 84 civilians were rescued, adding that ""the strike was carried out on purpose.""This is how Russia wages war - Sudzha, Kursk region, Russian territory, a boarding school with civilians preparing to evacuate,"" he wrote.""A Russian aerial bomb.",Negative
'My fear of hell was so great I was coerced to give up my baby',https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c9d5x83gg45o,"– Women who were once members of a secretive Christian sect in the United States have told the BBC they were coerced by the church into giving up their children for adoption.Hundreds of adoptions could have taken place between the 1950s and 1990s, say former members.The claims follow a BBC investigation last year into allegations of child sexual abuse spanning decades within the church, which is believed to have up to 100,000 members worldwide and is often referred to as The Truth or the Two by Twos. Four women—who were all unmarried at the time—have told us they were given no option but to give up their babies.One says she was pressured into giving her baby to a married couple in the church after she was raped in 1988, age 17.""My fear of going to hell was so great that it forced me to make up my mind to give up the baby to this couple in the church,"" she told the BBC.Another says she wasn't allowed to see her baby daughter before the child was taken away forever.The church, founded in Ireland by a Scottish evangelist in 1897, is built around ministers—known as workers—spreading New Testament teachings through word-of-mouth.Most of the mothers the BBC spoke to believe the workers—and The Truth as an institution—should shoulder most of the responsibility for the trauma caused by the adoptions.",Negative
'Woah that was close': Near-miss warning signs ahead of DC plane crash,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c391pe7lrv2o,"– Air traffic controllers and the White House have zeroed in on actions taken by the helicopter and on air traffic control staffing on the night of the crash as they speculate on what went wrong. It is the worst mid-air collision in America since the 1980s.MIT aeronautics professor R. John Hansman said that it's important to take stock of safety concerns, but also to recognize that the American aviation system is one of the safest in the world.""This was terrible,"" he said, noting there hasn't been a major commercial plane crash since 2009.Mr Slack, a licensed pilot and now aviation attorney, was sitting in the right pilot seat as his plane prepared to land on Runway 33—the same runway the doomed American Airlines flight approached when it collided mid-air with a helicopter this week.A departing Cessna Citation plane was pulling onto the runway to take off. His aircraft quickly aborted the landing, climbed back into the sky and began circling the airport to try again—a flight maneuver called a sudden go-around.Mr Slack's experience of a near-miss is not an isolated incident.The FAA and National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) are investigating the crash.President Donald Trump said: ""So sad to see the plane go down in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. More innocent souls lost.""An American Airlines flight that had departed from Wichita, Kansas, was coming in for a landing when it collided with a Sikorsky H-60 Black Hawk helicopter on Wednesday evening.Air traffic control conversations published online suggest that a controller warned the helicopter about the jet in the seconds before the collision.Mr Slack, a licensed pilot and now aviation attorney, was sitting in the right pilot seat as his plane prepared to land on Runway 33—the same runway the same runway the doomed American Airlines flight approached when it collided mid-air with a helicopter this week.It is also smaller than other airports, such as Dulles International Airport, with nearly 400 flights daily and 22,000 commercial flights per year.",Negative
