Trump congratulates Canada's Carney as they agree to meet in 'near future' US President Donald Trump and Prime Minister Mark Carney spoke after Canada's general election.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwy6lg3p7ero,"– President Trump has called Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney to congratulate him on his victory in the country's general election and the two have agreed meet in the near future.The two countries were expected to enter talks about a new economic and security relationship after Monday's vote.Trump's trade tariffs and repeated comments undermining Canada's sovereignty overshadowed the race, which ended with Carney's Liberals projected to win a minority government, according to public broadcaster CBC.It still marks a historic turnaround for a party that had seemed on course for collapse just months ago.Carney, a former central banker for Canada and the UK, will continue as prime minister, having stepped into the role last month following his unpopular predecessor Justin Trudeau's resignation.The office also said the two leaders had ""agreed on the importance of Canada and the United States working together—as independent, sovereign nations—for their mutual betterment.""In an interview with the BBC, Carney said that Canada deserves ""respect"" from the US and he will only allow a Canada-US trade and security partnership ""on our terms.""Carney has told the BBC that a 51st state scenario was ""never, ever going to happen.""",Positive
"Trump celebrates 100 days in office by touting record and blasting foes He tells a crowd in Michigan that he is using his presidency to deliver ""profound change"".",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c98gv43pjjno,"– President Trump has celebrated the 100th day of his second term in office with a campaign-style speech, touting his achievements and targeting political foes.Hailing what he called a ""revolution of common sense"", he told a crowd of supporters in Michigan that he was using his presidency to deliver ""profound change.""The Republican mocked his Democratic predecessor, Joe Biden, and aimed fresh criticism at the US Federal Reserve's chairman, while dismissing polls that show his own popularity slipping.Trump has delivered a dramatic fall in the number of migrants crossing illegally into the US, but the economy is a potential political vulnerability as he wages a global trade war. Trump screened a video of deportees being expelled from the US and sent to a mega-prison in El Salvador.The White House also said almost 65,700 immigrants had been deported in his term so far, although that is a slower pace than in the last fiscal year when US authorities deported more than 270,000.Trump's breakneck start is fraught with political risk'Kicking butt' or 'going too fast'?",Negative
"Trump calls Bezos as Amazon says no plan to show tariff price rises Donald Trump called Amazon founder Jeff Bezos to complain about the plan, which the company said had been rejected.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cdxg7xpr2j0o,"– The White House decision to go on the attack over the report is an indication of the pressure it is facing over its new import taxes, which analysts say will lead to higher prices for consumers and increase the chances of a recession. At a news conference marking the president's first 100 days in office on Tuesday, press secretary Karoline Leavitt said she had discussed Amazon's reported move with the president and argued it represented ""another reason why Americans should buy American"".""This is a hostile and political act by Amazon,"" she said.Asked about the report, Amazon spokesperson Tim Doyle confirmed that the company had considered the idea of listing import charges on certain products for its Amazon Haul store.But it said it had decided not to move forward and the idea had never been under consideration for its main platform.The White House decision to go on the attack over the report is an indication of the pressure it is facing over its new import taxes, which analysts say will lead to higher prices for consumers and increase the chances of a recession.Trump has ramped up tariffs since re-entering office in January, measures he argues will boost manufacturing and raise tax revenue for the US.",Negative

"How Spain powered back to life from unprecedented national blackout However diversified Spain's energy mix is, the blackout required an enormous effort to get back up and running.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c175ykvjxyeo,"– The prime minister highlighted the sudden loss of 15 gigawatts of electricity at 12:33 on Monday, when about 60% of Spain's power generation suddenly vanished.It was not until 11:15 (09:15 GMT) on Tuesday, almost 23 hours after the system collapsed that Spain's electricity grid declared it was back to normal.The trains have started running again although some lines are suspended and most homes have got their power back.The initial focus was to get the northern and southern power generating regions working again, which grid operator Red Eléctrica said was key to ""gradually re-energising the transmission grid as the generating units are connected.""The risk lay in overloading the system by turning everything on at the same time and triggering another massive outage.The initial focus was on hydro-electric plants, in particular pumped-storage plants with reservoirs full at this time of year and able to produce electricity fast from a standing start.Spain's Guardia Civil police force said it had rescued 13,000 passengers trapped on trains.Electricity provider Endesa said it had restored almost 3.5 million customers by 19:15 and had prioritized hospitals and other strategic infrastructure.Just over an hour later the head of Red Eléctrica boss Eduardo Prieto said about 9,200 MW of demand—about 35.1%—had been restored.The CEOE bosses' organization has estimated a 1.6bn hit on the economy.The political blame game has already begun.",Negative
"Trump's first 100 days - in numbers We measure this US presidency so far on polling, actions, economy and immigration.",https://www.bbc.com/news/resources/idt-17e9c07b-93f4-45b3-9558-7590b9eaf3ad,"– President Trump's second-term approval rating has been compared with that of his predecessors by US polling firm Gallup, which has used the 100-day milestone for decades. Trump is the first post-war president to serve two non-consecutive terms, which is why he has two sets of ratings. Here are all the presidents except Donald Trump elected since World War Two, ordered by their approval rating just before the 100-day mark. John F Kennedy enjoyed 83% of public approval and Ronald Reagan had 67%. Joe Biden and Bill Clinton were less popular but still above 50%. Trump is the only post-war president to have less than half the public's support at 100 days, in both his terms.",Positive
Australia's last vote was all about Indigenous people - now they say it's 'silence' Prime Minister Anthony Albanese and Opposition leader Peter Dutton have had little to say on First Nations issues.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx2v6zy2nyvo,"– ""It's weird,"" says Suzanne Andrews, chief executive of the town's Gurriny Yealamucka Health Services. ""We don't see any placards. No-one's visiting us."" Watching the leaders of Australia's two major parties debate each other on television, the Jaru Bunuba Bardi woman was dismayed that ""they didn't talk about any Aboriginal issues or concerns"".""So,"" she asks ""what the hell's going on?"" Indigenous Australians, who represent about 3.8% of the nation's 26 million population, are by most socio-economic measures the most disadvantaged people in the country—something successive leaders have for years called a ""national shame.""Yet in this election campaign, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese and Opposition leader Peter Dutton have had little to say on First Nations issues.The glaring exception this week, when during the final leader's debate Dutton said Indigenous ""welcome to country"" ceremonies—where a local Aboriginal person acknowledges and give consent to events taking place on their traditional lands—were 'overdone' and should not take place so frequently.The comments represent one of the only times on the campaign trail that Dutton has publicly addressed issues specifically relating to First Nations people—and not to discuss disadvantage, but within the context of a culture war.Part of the reason politicians try to steer clear of First Nations issues, according to experts and advocates, is that many believe they are too divisive and therefore risky—especially after the failure of the Voice to Parliament referendum in 2023.",Positive
"Fire destroys historic US church with ties to MLK The Clayborn Temple in Memphis, Tennessee, was the organising centre for Martin Luther King Jr's final campaign in 1968.",https://www.bbc.com/news/videos/c77ngj2yge1o,"– A historic Black church in Memphis, Tennessee, caught fire early Monday morning and suffered significant damage. The Clayborn Temple was the staging point for marches to City Hall, including a march led by Martin Luther King Jr on 28 March 1968, which turned violent when police and protesters clashed on Beale Street. Before the fire, the church was undergoing a $25 million restoration that was slated to be completed in 2026. The fire is still under investigation, according to the Memphis Fire Chief.",Negative
"Trump's breakneck start is fraught with political risk Sarah Smith: After 100 days of action and noise, there are dangers to the administration's shock-and-awe approach.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/crm30ddlj0xo,"– President Trump has spent many years talking about the good that tariffs could do for America's economy—and now he is trying to make it a reality—but staking your presidency on a policy of global economic disruption comes with significant risks.Trump has already reacted to tanking global markets by announcing tariff pauses, and he has signaled he is ready to make a deal with China by recently making warmer comments than the earlier angry barbs aimed at Beijing.But in July, steep tariffs on imports from any countries that do not have a trade deal with the US are set to come into force.Can the administration really agree 90 trade deals in 90 days as Trump has promised? Voters who backed the president in November, at least many I have spoken to, appreciate the White House message that he is standing up to countries that have for decades taken advantage of the US and seeking to inject fresh life into American manufacturing.But there is a tension between this message and what plays out on the ground - not in diplomatic talks between leaders, but on main streets and in supermarkets as Americans go about their daily lives.Trump's tariff plans have driven a stock market sell-off and raised fears of economic recession.The administration has admitted it made a mistake when deporting him to a notorious prison in El Salvador, but appears unwilling to follow a Supreme Court order to ""facilitate"" his return to the US.So far, the White House has avoided the kind of clash with judges that could prompt a full-blown constitutional crisis, even as it has maneuvered around court rulings aimed at limiting some of its most radical policy moves.",Negative
