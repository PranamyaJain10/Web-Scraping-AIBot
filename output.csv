"Hamas makes hostage pledge but demands changes to US Gaza ceasefire plan The response is seen as neither an explicit rejection nor clear acceptance of the proposal, but US envoy Steve Witkoff has branded it ""unacceptable"".",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c17rzyw72jko,"– Hamas responded to a US ceasefire proposal by saying it is prepared to release 10 living Israeli hostages and 18 dead hostages in exchange for a number of Palestinian prisoners, while requesting some amendments to the plan.The group repeated its demands for a permanent truce, a complete Israeli withdrawal from Gaza and guarantees for the continuous flow of humanitarian aid.Hamas said it had submitted its response to the US draft proposed by Steve Witkoff, US President Donald Trump's special envoy for the Middle East.In a statement, Witkoff said: ""I received the Hamas response to the United States' proposal. It is totally unacceptable and only takes us backward.Hamas should accept the framework proposal we put forward as the basis for proximity talks, which we can begin immediately this coming week.""A statement from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office said: ""While Israel has agreed to the updated Witkoff outline for the release of our hostages, Hamas continues to adhere to its refusal.""Hamas, a proscribed terror group in the US, UK, and EU, said it was insisting on a ""permanent ceasefire"" and ""complete withdrawal"" of Israeli forces from the Gaza Strip.The group demanded a sustained flow of aid for Palestinians living in the enclave, and said it would release 10 living hostages and the bodies of 18 dead hostages in exchange for ""an agreed upon number"" of Palestinian prisoners in Israel.But Hamas now finds itself in the most complex and difficult position it has faced since the war began.Under intense pressure from 2.2 million people living in the worst conditions in their history and from the mediators, the movement is unable to accept an American proposal that is, by all accounts, less generous than previous offers it has rejected multiple times, the most recent being in March.",Negative
"Gaza aid trucks rushed by desperate and hungry crowds, WFP says ""Starving people will not let a food truck pass. They need to feed their families"", the World Food Programme said.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/czxy33z7p2lo,"– The World Food Program has said, as hunger and desperation create chaotic scenes.The humanitarian organization said it had brought 77 trucks loaded with flour into Gaza overnight and early on Saturday.""All trucks were stopped along the way, with food taken mainly by hungry people trying to feed their families,"" WFP said.After nearly 80 days of a total blockade, starving people will not let a food truck pass,"" the WFP added.Israel eased an 11-week aid blockade on 19 May, but the UN says the amount sent in the last week amounts to just over 10% of people's needs.The UN Palestinian refugee agency chief said the 900 trucks sent in to Gaza over the past week were ""just over 10% of the daily needs of people.""The aid that's being sent now makes a mockery to the mass tragedy unfolding under our watch,"" Philippe Lazzarini said on X.Israeli military agency Cogat has accused the UN of not distributing aid already inside Gaza, with Israel's foreign ministry saying hundreds of trucks are waiting.The statistics do not include the North Gaza Governorate, where the last hospital closed on Thursday after the Israeli military ordered its evacuation.",Negative
US sends nuclear deal proposal to Iran It comes after the UN nuclear watchdog warned Iran has stepped up its production of enriched uranium.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ce82g704rd2o,"– The US has sent Iran a proposal for a nuclear deal between Tehran and Washington, the White House confirmed on Saturday.Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said he had been presented with ""elements of a US deal"" by his Omani counterpart Badr Albusaidi during a short visit to the Iranian capital.It comes after a report by the UN nuclear watchdog said Iran had further stepped up its production of enriched uranium, a key component in the making of nuclear weapons.White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said on Saturday it was in Tehran's ""best interest to accept"" the deal, adding: ""President Trump has made it clear that Iran can never obtain a nuclear bomb.""The US proposal ""will be appropriately responded to in line with the principles, national interests and rights of the people of Iran"", Araghchi wrote on X.The precise details of the deal are not yet clear.The proposal follows a report by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) - seen by the BBC - which found Iran now possesses over 400kg of uranium enriched to 60% purity - close to the 90% purity required for weapons-grade uranium.It is enough for about 10 nuclear weapons if further refined, making Iran the only non nuclear-armed state producing uranium at this level.The report paves the way for the US, Britain, France, Germany, and Germany to push for the IAEA's board of governors to find Iran in violation of its non-proliferation obligations.Iran insists its program is peaceful.Trump is seeking a new nuclear agreement with Tehran after pulling the US out of a previous nuclear agreement between Iran and six world powers in 2018.",Positive

The fallout from Trump's war on Harvard will long outlast his presidency The US president's ramped-up threats are seen by many as an attempt to reshape a stronghold of the left. Could he succeed?,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0ln9lexyedo,"– Harvard's commencement ceremonies on Thursday, students said there was a ""palpable concern"" on campus.""People sort of knew Trump was trying some of these moves but [they were] shocked when it happens,"" admits one graduate, a British national who requested anonymity because he was concerned public comments could threaten his US work visa.But the repercussions of this apparent Harvard-Trump fight run far deeper than the management of a single Ivy League university.Trump's directives represent a frontal attack on one of America's most prestigious, and wealthy, institutions of higher education.Even if court challenges overrule some of these actions—some have already been put on hold—the impact is being felt across the landscape of American higher education.Trump and his administration have offered various explanations for their actions, including a perceived lack of conservatives among the ranks of Harvard's professors, along with suggestions of admitting too many foreign students and financial links to China.But according to the White House, the most immediate cause has been the university's apparent failure to address antisemitism on campus, in the wake of anti-Israel protests at universities across the US since the start of the Gaza war.",Negative
They helped oust a president - now South Korean women say they feel invisible again A snap presidential election has exposed South Korea's stark gender divide.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy8njzr42zvo,"– They returned week after week as the investigation into Yoon Suk Yeol's abuse of power went on—and they rejoiced when he was impeached after four dramatic months.But now, I wonder if anything has really improved...

I can't shake the feeling that they're trying to erase women's voices.""An analysis by BBC Korean found that women in their 20s were the largest demographic at one rally in December, where there were 200,000 of them—almost 18% of those in attendance.The two main candidates have been largely silent about equality for women.And yet, with the country set to elect a new president on 3 June, those very women say they feel invisible again.",Positive

Silent acts of resistance and fear under Russian occupation in Ukraine Three Ukrainians describe everyday life and the risks of defying Russian occupation.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/czj40rn8k0wo,"– A fifth of Ukrainian territory is now under Russian control, and for Ukrainians living under occupation there seems little chance that any future deal to end the war will change that.Three Ukrainians in different Russian-controlled cities have told the BBC of the pressures they face, from being forced to accept a Russian passport to the risks of carrying out small acts of resistance.The potential dangers are the same, whether in Mariupol or Melitopol, seized by Russia in the full-scale invasion in 2022, or in Crimea which was annexed eight years before.Mavka chose to stay in Melitopol when the Russians invaded her city on 25 February 2022, ""because it is unfair that someone can just come to my home and take it out.""If someone's child, let's say, refuses to sing the Russian anthem at school in the morning, the FSB [Russia's security service] will visit their parents, they will be 'pencilled in' and then anything can happen.""Most of those who stayed in Mariupol or returned, did so to help their elderly parents or their sick grandparents, or because of their flat,"" he tells me over the phone after midnight so no-one will overhear.Iryna complains that she cannot go out on her own even for coffee ""because solders can put a gun at you and say something abusive or order you to please them.""It helps us to keep our spirits high, reminding us about our happy life before the occupation.""Mavka talks of being part of a secret female resistance movement called Zla Mavka (Angry Mavka) ""to let people know that Ukrainians don't agree with the occupation, we didn't call for it, and we will never tolerate it.""

EU 'strongly' regrets US plan to double steel tariffs,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx2eg42nzpwo,"– The EU has said it ""strongly"" regrets Donald Trump's surprise plan to double US tariffs on steel and aluminium in a move that risks throwing bilateral trade talks into chaos. On Friday, the US president told a rally in the steel-making city of Pittsburgh that the tariffs would rise from 25% to 50%, claiming this would boost local industry and national supplies.The European Commission told the BBC on Saturday that Trump's latest move on tariffs ""undermines ongoing efforts"" to reach a deal, warning about ""countermeasures.""This also raises questions about the UK's zero tariff deal with the US on steel and aluminium which, although agreed, has not yet been signed.The announcement comes amid a court battle over the legality of some of Trump's global tariffs, which an appeals court has allowed to continue after the Court of International Trade ordered the administration to halt the taxes.Trump also said that $14bn (£10bn) would be invested in the area's steel production through a partnership between US Steel and Japan's Nippon Steel, though he later told reporters he had yet to see or approve the final deal.The announcement was the latest turn in Trump's rollercoaster approach to tariffs since re-entering office in January.",Negative
People say coke and fries are helping their migraines - but there's a twist,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c23mrl5x53ro,"– A simple offering of a full-fat coke and a portion of salty fries seems to be doing the trick for hundreds who've been extolling its virtues on TikTok. While there are medical treatments, there is no cure. Prescription medication can be very effective—but it doesn't always work. Dr Kay Kennis, a GP who specializes in migraines, says while there are elements of the McMigraine meal that can help stave off an attack, these aren't innate to ""a McDonald's.""She also warns that not only is fast food often ultra-processed and not conducive to a healthy diet, it can contain high levels of Tyramine, a natural compound commonly found in many foods, which can actually cause severe migraines.The chronic migraine sufferer has been looking for a ""magic cocktail"" for seven years—she's seen people recommend putting feet in scorching water (not recommended by experts and potentially dangerous); drinking hot coffee (caffeine can be a trigger); or various vibrating devices which have had little effect.""It can help,"" she says cautiously, ""but it's certainly not a cure.""Migraine is a complex neurological condition—and it can't be cured by a bit of caffeine, salt and sugar in a fast food meal.""Kayleigh's tried cocktails of different medications, putting her feet in hot water, a flannel at the back of the head, acupuncture, cupping—but they've had little effect.Other ingredients in a fast food meal, like the salt on the chips, can affect nerve activity, she explains, but adds the effects of sodium on migraines have not been tested. Dr Kennis warns against using caffeinated fizzy drinks like coke as a way of regularly managing migraines.",Positive
