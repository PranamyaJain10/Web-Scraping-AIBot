"Putin says Russia will use new missile again in 'combat conditions' Ukraine's President Zelensky has urged a ""serious response"" to Moscow's use of its Oreshnik ballistic missile",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx28dzvxjyjo,"– Russia has a stock of powerful new missiles ""ready to be used"", President Vladimir Putin has said, a day after his country fired a new ballistic missile at the Ukrainian city of Dnipro.In an unscheduled TV address, the Russian leader said the Oreshnik missile could not be intercepted and promised to carry out more tests, including in ""combat conditions."" Putin said the Oreshnik hypersonic missiles flew at 10 times the speed of sound and ordered them to be put into production. Thursday's strike on Dnipro was described as unusual by eyewitnesses and triggered explosions which went on for three hours.The attack included a strike by a missile so powerful that in the Ukrainian officials said it resembled an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM).Justin Crump, CEO and founder of the risk advisory company Sibylline, told the BBC that Moscow likely used the strike as a warning, noting that the missile—which is faster and more advanced that others in its arsenal—has the capacity to seriously challenge Ukraine's air defenses, he added.Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky called for world leaders to give a ""serious response"" so that Putin ""feels the real consequences of his actions.""Chinese Prime Minister Viktor Orban meanwhile said the West should take Vladimir Putin's warnings ""at face value"" because Russia ""bases its policies primarily on military power.""And North Korea's leader Kim Jong Un warned ""never before"" had the threat of a nuclear war been greater and accused the US of having an ""aggressive and hostile"" policy towards Pyongyang.",Negative
"The week of rising stakes in the Ukraine war Russia made its loudest threat yet of nuclear war, as Western powers bolstered Ukraine's arsenal.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvgxly3nzwpo,"– The stakes have never been higher in the Ukraine-Russia war.In the week that saw the conflict pass its 1000th day, Western powers substantially boosted Ukraine's military arsenal—and the Kremlin made its loudest threats yet of a nuclear strike.Here is how the last week played out—and what it means. Late on Sunday night, reports emerged that outgoing US President Joe Biden had given Ukraine permission to use longer-range ATACMS missiles to strike targets inside Russia.The move marked a major policy change by Washington—which for months had refused Ukraine's requests to use the missiles beyond its own borders.After the decision was leaked to the press, a volley of ATACMS missiles were fired by Ukraine into Russia's Bryansk region.The Kremlin said six were fired, with five intercepted, while anonymous US officials claimed it was eight, with two intercepted.Ukraine launched UK-supplied Storm Shadow missiles at targets in Russia's Kursk region—where Ukrainian troops have seized a roughly 600-sq km (232 sq mile) patch of Russian territory.Later in the week, Biden added the final element of a ramped-up weapons arsenal to Ukraine by approving the use of anti-personnel landmines.The US and UK are now more deeply involved than ever—while the deployment of North Korean troops to fight alongside Russia saw another nuclear power enter the war.North Korean leader Kim Jong Un said on Thursday that ""never before"" has the threat of a nuclear war been greater, blaming the US for its ""aggressive and hostile"" policy towards Pyongyang.",Negative

"Trump's withdrawn attorney general pick will not return to Congress Trump tapped Matt Gaetz, who faces a House ethics investigation, to be the US's top law enforcement officer.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cj0jgle8qnyo,"– Matt Gaetz, who withdrew from consideration as attorney general in Donald Trump's cabinet over ethics allegations, says he will not return to his seat in the US House of Representatives.Gaetz told a conservative radio host: ""I'm still going to be in the fight, but it's going to be from a new perch.""A staunch Trump ally and leader of a hard-right faction in the House, Gaetz resigned his seat shortly after being picked by the president-elect to lead the Department of Justice.But after eight days of scrutiny and growing uncertainty that he would be able to get through the US Senate's confirmation process, he withdrew his nomination on Thursday. Gaetz, 42, has been the subject of allegations of human trafficking, illegal drug use, and paying for sex, including with a 17-year-old.House ethics investigations generally end if a representative resigns or is voted out of their seat.If Gaetz had chosen to rejoin the House, however, he may have faced having the investigation re-opened.Gaetz said: ""If the things that the House Ethics report [said] were true, I would be under indictment and probably in a prison cell.“But of course, they're false, because when you test them against other records, when you test them against other testimony, it all falls apart very quickly.”",Negative
"Pro-athlete burglaries may be linked to international crime ring Several players have been robbed while traveling for games, including Travis Kelce and Patrick Mahomes.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cgk1644j5y5o,"– An international crime ring may be behind burglaries targeting the homes of professional athletes across the US, although experts caution that local groups could also be responsible. In recent weeks, several NFL players and an NBA player have been robbed while traveling for games, including Kansas City Chiefs player Travis Kelce and his teammate Patrick Mahomes. The FBI is investigating whether the burglaries could be connected to a transnational crime operation with links to South America, a source familiar with the investigation told the BBC's US partner CBS News. ""It's a transnational crime ring, and over the last three weeks, they've focused on NBA and NFL players, and it's all over the country,"" a source familiar with the situation told NFL.com. But Michael Tabman, a former FBI special agent, said there could be a simpler explanation. ""It could be possible that you have some capable burglars in Kansas City who maybe have some inside information,"" he said. The NFL has been warning players about the crimes, sending a memo this week which said ""organised and skilled groups"" appeared to be targeting them.",Positive
Trump nominates Scott Bessent to lead US Treasury in flurry of announcements The president-elect also nominates Congresswoman Lori Chavez-DeRemer as his pick for Labor Secretary.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cj3mv6l1ypyo,"– Donald Trump has nominated Scott Bessent to lead the US Treasury Department, a post with wide oversight of tax policy, public debt, international finance and sanctions.The selection ends what has proven to be one of the more protracted decisions for the president-elect as he assembles his team for a second term.Bessent, a Wall Street financier who once worked for George Soros, was an early backer of Trump's 2024 bid and would bring a relatively conventional resume to the role.On the campaign trail, he told voters that Trump would usher in a ""new golden age with de-regulation, low-cost energy, [and] low taxes.""However, Bessent has been a strong proponent of Trump's embrace of the crypto industry.Bessent, a native of South Carolina, graduated from Yale University and started his career at the Brown Brothers Harriman, one of the oldest investment firms in the US.He made his name in the 1990s betting against the British pound and Japanese yen while working for Soros, a major Democratic donor.Trump has also called for controversial changes to trade policy, proposing sweeping tariffs on all goods coming into the country.Bessent, a Wall Street financier who once worked for George Soros, was an early backer of Trump's 2024 bid and would bring a relatively conventional resume to the role.Trump also announced his backing for Dr Janette Nesheiwat as Surgeon General, one of the most senior health positions in the country, and Russell Vought as director of the US Office of Management and Budget which helps decide policy priorities and how they should be funded.Vought, who played a major role in Project 2025—a ""wish list"" for a second Trump presidency by the conservative Heritage Foundation—held the same position during Trump's first term.",Positive
Two men found guilty in smuggling deaths of family at US-Canada border A Minnesota jury found the men guilty of helping the Patels make the fatal journey in January 2022.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c2e72yxxyzmo,"– A Minnesota jury has found two men guilty of helping smuggle an Indian family from Canada to the US in January 2022, leading to their deaths. Harshkumar Ramanlal Patel and Steve Anthony Shand were found guilty on all counts of human trafficking, criminal conspiracy, and culpable homicide not amounting to murder. Both had pleaded not guilty to the charges in relation to the death of the Patel family, whose bodies were found frozen in a Manitoba field by Canadian authorities 12m (39ft) from the US border.The trial has shed light on human smuggling operations that help foreign nationals move to North America unlawfully. Prosecutors said the family—who had traveled on visitor visas from their home village in western India to Toronto, Canada—were trying to cross into the US when they were caught in the blinding blizzard and temperatures as low as -35C (-31F).The trial exposed the workings of a complex, international network that sought to illegally funnel immigrants into the United States through Canada at great risk to would-be migrants and great profit to smugglers.",Negative

Texas schools can now teach Bible-based reading lessons,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0mzyexv018o,"– The Texas State Board of Education on Friday approved a controversial, Bible-infused curriculum for public school students in kindergarten through fifth grade.Texas schools will not be required to use ""BlueBonnet"" curriculum, which includes lessons from the books of Genesis and Psalms, as well as the New Testament, but will receive extra funding if they do.The board's narrow vote of 8 to 7 marks the latest move by Republicans to incorporate Christian teachings into schools nationwide.Four Democrats and three Republicans voted against using the curriculum.The vote was only for adding the curriculum to English Language Arts and Reading, but the board is considering using it in other areas.The curriculum will be used in classrooms from August 2025.School districts can design their own lesson plans and are not forced to adopt the curriculum, but will receive a funding incentive of $40 per student to buy learning materials if they do.Similar efforts are being made in other US, Republican-dominated states.",Positive
Judge delays Trump sentencing for a third time,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cz9xl79ny7eo,"– A New York judge again delayed Donald Trump's sentencing in his historical criminal case as he continues to push for the conviction to be tossed.Trump, who was found guilty of 34 felony fraud counts in May, was supposed to be sentenced on 26 November - less than two months before his presidential inauguration.His lawyers argue that his conviction should be thrown out on the grounds of presidential immunity, and because sentencing would interfere with his duties as president.The Manhattan district attorney who prosecuted Trump is fighting for the sentencing, but has suggested that it could wait until after Trump's second term.On Friday, in what Trump's team is calling a victory, Justice Juan Merchan paused all proceedings until he receives further arguments from both parties in December.But the court is now up against a ticking clock to decide what's next, as Trump's inauguration in late January grows ever closer.In July, the US Supreme Court ruled that presidents have immunity from criminal prosecution for certain official acts undertaken while in office.Trump's attorneys in his New York criminal trial argue those protections should extend to this case as well.The sentencing battle was postponed until after the election, which Trump won decisively on 5 November.",Negative
