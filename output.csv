"Top Hezbollah commander killed in Israeli strike on Beirut The strike in Lebanon's capital, which killed at least 14 people, adds to fears of an all-out war.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5y9wyy9pr2o,"– A top Hezbollah military commander was killed in an Israeli air strike on the Lebanese capital Beirut on Friday, in a major escalation that has added to fears of an all-out war.Hezbollah confirmed Ibrahim Aqil's death after Israel said he was one of several senior Hezbollah figures killed in the strike.Earlier, Lebanese officials said at least 14 people were killed and dozens injured in the strike that hit the densely populated Dahieh area, a stronghold of the Iran-backed group in the city's southern suburbs.Israel recently added the return of people displaced from the north of the country to its list of war goals, and Defense Minister Yoav Gallant said on Thursday that his country is entering a ""new phase of the war"", concentrating more of its efforts on the north. Friday's strike was the first to hit Beirut since July, when Hezbollah's military chief Fuad Shukr was killed.In a statement, Israel Defense Forces (IDF) spokesman Daniel Hagari said Aqil, a senior commander in Hezbollah's elite Radwan forces, was killed alongside senior operatives in the group's operations staff and other Radwan commanders.Hagari said they ""were gathered underground under a residential building in the heart of the Dahiyah neighborhood [in southern Beirut], hiding among Lebanese civilians, using them as human shields.""The IDF spokesman added that the individuals killed were ""planning Hezbollah's 'Conquer the Galilee' attack plan, in which Hezbollah intended to infiltrate Israeli communities and murder innocent civilians.""The plan was first reported by the Israeli military in 2018, when the IDF said it was blocking tunnels dug by Hezbollah to penetrate Israeli territory and kidnap and murder civilians.",Negative

The owner of the plant, Constellation Energy, said the reactor it planned to restart was next to, but ""fully independent"" of, the unit that had been involved in the 1979 accident.It caused no injuries or deaths but provoked widespread fear and mistrust among the US public, discouraging the development of nuclear power in the US for decades.However, there is renewed interest in nuclear as concerns about climate change grow - and companies need more energy due to advances in artificial intelligence.
