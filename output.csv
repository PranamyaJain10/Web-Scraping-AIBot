"Ukraine official says minerals deal  agreed with US Donald Trump says the deal would give Ukraine ""the right to fight on"" in its war with Russia.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c337461n3xlo,"– Ukraine has agreed the terms of a major minerals deal with the US, a senior official in Kyiv has told the BBC.We have indeed agreed it with a number of good amendments and see it as a positive outcome,"" the official said, without providing any further details.Media reports say Washington has dropped initial demands for a right to $500bn (£395bn) in potential revenue from utilizing the natural resources but has not given firm security guarantees to war-torn Ukraine—a key Ukrainian demand.US President Donald Trump said he was expecting his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelensky in Washington to sign the deal this week, after the two leaders exchanged strong words about each other.Trump has been pushing for access to Ukraine's minerals in return for previous military and other aid to the country since Moscow launched a full-scale invasion three years ago.Zelensky argued nowhere near that much American aid had been provided, adding: 'I can't sell our state.'",Positive
Will UK PM's defence spending hike win over Trump? The prime minister has set out plans to increase defence spending to 2.5% of national income by 2027.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvg584grxwwo,"– The prime minister may suggest the UK is showing leadership, pointing the way for other European allies to follow suit.He may also argue that the defense hike shows the UK will not have to make what he calls the ""historic mistake"" of having to choose between Europe and the US, something made much harder by the US decision to vote with Russia against Ukraine and Europe at the United Nations on Monday.The government's promised increase in defense spending may be seen as a short-term tactical move ahead of Starmer's visit to Washington, rather than an historic response to the existential geopolitical changes posed by Trump's election. Aid charities noted that their spending was a soft target compared to those of massive spending departments such as welfare, health and education.But few politicians of any political color appear prepared to start making an argument for a transformation of the post-war European welfare model and prepare voters for a massive change in defense spending.The reduction from 0.5% of national income to 0.3% means £6bn less will be spent on foreign aid each year.The prime minister said the UK would use this remaining aid money to help Sudan, Ukraine and Gaza, tackle climate change, and support multinational efforts on global health.Aid charities were stunned.",Positive

"Six babies have died from cold in Gaza over two weeks, medics say Five newborns and a two-month-old have reportedly died, with doctors blaming a lack of shelter and heating.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c62k676gk34o,"– At least six babies have died in the past two weeks in Gaza due to the cold weather and lack of adequate shelter and heating, Palestinian medics and health officials say.Doctors at the Patient's Friends Benevolent Society hospital in Gaza City, in the north, said nine newborn babies suffering from cold injuries had been admitted, five of whom had died, with one other in a critical condition.The family of a two-month-old girl also said she had died due to the cold near the southern city of Khan Younis overnight.The PFBS hospital called for the urgent delivery of caravans and fuel to improve conditions for the estimated 945,000 displaced Palestinians living in tents and makeshift shelters.The Palestinian armed group Hamas has accused Israel of failing to allow in agreed amounts of tents, caravans and other shelter supplies during a ceasefire that began five weeks ago.Israel has denied this.Most of Gaza's 2.1 million population has been displaced multiple times during the 16-month war between Israel and Hamas and almost 70% of buildings in the territory are estimated to be damaged or destroyed.The healthcare system has also collapsed, with only 18 of the 35 hospitals partially functional and shortages of essential medical equipment.",Negative

"Billion Indians have no spending money - report India's population is 1.4 billion but its consuming class is only 140 million, or about as big as Mexico.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c8rk5d7ekjmo,"– India is home to 1.4 billion people, but around a billion among them don't have enough money to spend on any discretionary goods or services, a new report estimates.The country's consuming class, which is effectively the potential market for start-ups or business owners, is only about as big as Mexico— 130-140 million people—according to the report from Blume Ventures, a venture capital firm.There are another 300 million ""emerging"" or ""aspirant"" consumers, but they are reluctant spenders who've only just begun to open their purse strings, as click-of-a-button digital payments make it easy to transact.What's more, the consuming class in Asia's third largest economy isn't ""widening"" as much as it is ""deepening"", according to the report.The country's central bank has also cracked down on easy unsecured lending that propped up demand post the Covid.Much of the consumption spending of the ""emerging"" or ""aspirant"" class was led by such borrowings and ""turning off that tap will definitely have some impact on consumption.""The report's findings bolster the long-held view that India's post-pandemic recovery has been K-shaped—where the rich have gotten richer, while the poor have lost purchasing power.In fact, this has been a long-term structural trend that began even before the pandemic.India has been getting increasingly more unequal, with the top 10% of Indians now holding 57.7% of national income compared with 34% in 1990.",Positive
