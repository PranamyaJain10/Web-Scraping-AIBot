But soul-searching over where she went wrong and what else she could have done will likely take longer as Democrats begin finger-pointing and raising questions about the future of the party.Harris campaign officials were silent in the early Wednesday hours while some aides expressed tearful shock over what was expected to be a much closer race.Harris tried to walk the fine line of addressing the administration's record without casting shade on her boss, showing a reluctance to break with any of Biden's policies while also not outwardly promoting them on the campaign trail.But she then failed to deliver a convincing argument about why she should lead the country, and how she would handle economic frustrations as well as widespread concerns over immigration.She began her 100-day campaign promising a ""new generation of leadership"", rallying women around abortion rights and vowing to win back working-class voters by focusing on economic issues including rising costs and housing affordability.She lost 13 points with Latino voters, two points with black voters, and six points with voters under 30, according to exit polls, which may change as votes are counted, but are considered representative of trends.
