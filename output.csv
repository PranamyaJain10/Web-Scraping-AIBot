"General's assassination pierces Moscow's air of normality The killing of Igor Kirillov is a wake-up call for the Russian capital, writes Steve Rosenberg.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/czjdmgnj242o,"– Russia's war on Ukraine hit home when Lt Gen Igor Kirillov and his assistant Ilya Polikarpov were killed by a bomb concealed on an electric scooter, the reality of Russia's war on Ukraine hit home.At least to those Russians close to the crime scene.""It's one thing reading about it in the news, it feels far, but when it happens next door to you, that's completely different and frightening,"" Liza tells me.My anxiety has gone through the roof.The host of a political talk show on Russian state TV blamed Ukraine and claimed that ""with this attack President Zelensky has signed his own death sentence.""From President Vladimir Putin there has been no public reaction so far to the killing of the general and his assistant.But the Kremlin leader has said many times before that, faced with security threats, Russia ""will always respond.""The killing of a Russian general in Moscow: that is a definite wake-up call; proof that this war is very real and very close to home.Will it serve as a wake-up call for the Russian authorities?Probably not.There is little sign of a Kremlin U-turn on Ukraine.Moscow is far more likely to intensify the war.Reacting to news of Kirillov's killing, the host of a political talk show on Russian state TV blamed Ukraine and claimed that ""with this attack President Zelensky has signed his own death sentence.""Former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev said ""investigators must find the killers in Russia.""",Negative
Ukraine's spies target Russian figures in increasingly brazen attacks Attacks on Russian figures have become more brazen as Ukrainian special services penetrate security in Moscow.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cm2lvv3y6g9o,"– The assassination of Lt Gen Igor Kirillov is believed be the highest-ranking military official killed beyond the combat zone since its full-scale invasion began.His assassination has shocked Russia's military and political establishment.The fact that Ukrainian intelligence can target the head of Russia's military's radiation, biological and chemical protection forces outside his home in south-eastern Moscow raises questions about Russian security and how far Ukraine's capabilities can extend. Choosing a scooter for the attack was a smart move.But as they detonated the device at precisely the right moment, in this case when Gen Kirillov was leaving his apartment block alongside his aide, the perpetrators must have had some sort of visual surveillance—either monitoring via camera or watching it in person.The fact that Kirillov's killing took place within days of Shatsky's murder shows how deep Ukraine's spies have penetrated into Russia.It could be the result of an internal power struggle among the Russian military or the Kremlin's attempt to remove one of the main witnesses of war crimes, says Yuriy Karin, a Kyiv-based military observer.Only five days ago, a leading Russian missile scientist, Mikhail Shatsky, was shot dead in a forest outside Moscow.",Negative

Gisèle Pelicot: How an ordinary woman shook attitudes to rape in France The verdicts aren't yet in - but the trial has already started changing the conversations around consent in the country and beyond,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cd75v8eqz44o,"– Gisle Pelicot's courageous stand and her determination—as she has put it, to make ""shame swap sides"" from the victim to the rapist—change anything? A long trial creates its own microclimate and, over the past weeks, a strange sort of normality developed inside Avignon's Palais de Justice.The accused strolled around, chatting, joking, grabbing coffee from the machine or returning from a café across the road, and, in the process, somehow emphasised the core argument of their various defense strategies: that these were just regular guys, a cross-section of French society, who were looking for a'swinging' adventure online and got caught up in something unexpected.The second question emerges from the first: how far will this trial go in helping to tackle an epidemic of sexual violence and indulging of drug-facilitated rape, and in challenging deeply held prejudices and ignorance about shame and consent?Put simply, will Gisle Pelicot's courageous stand and her determination—as she has put it, to make'shame swap sides' from the victim to the rapist—change anything?'",Negative
"Trump sues Iowa-based newspaper for 'election interference' Trump, who recently won a $15m settlement from ABC in a defamation lawsuit, has a history of suing news outlets.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cdjg2n3xv7zo,"– President-elect Donald Trump is suing the Des Moines Register newspaper, along with its parent company and its former pollster, for ""brazen election interference"" over a poll published days before the 2024 presidential election. The Nov. 2 poll suggested Democratic nominee Kamala Harris would win Iowa, a predominantly Republican state. Trump filed the lawsuit fresh off the victory of having ABC News settle a defamation lawsuit for $15m (£12m), over an anchor falsely saying Trump was found liable for rape last year (he was liable for sexual abuse).Trump's often hostile approach to the American press goes back to his first presidential campaign, and is expected to carry into his second term. He announced his plans to sue the Iowa-based paper during a news conference on Monday where he called the press ""corrupt."" The lawsuit was filed in Polk County, Iowa, later that morning.In it, he accuses renowned pollster J. Ann Selzer of ""brazen election interference.""The Des Moines Register lawsuit comes after ABC News agreed to pay $15m (£12m) as a charitable contribution to a ""presidential foundation and museum"" that Trump is expected to establish for his post-presidency life.Trump is asking the court to award him financial damages and cover his attorneys' fees, and also to compel the news outlet to ""disweighted all information upon which they relied"" for the poll.Spokesperson for the Des Moines Register Lark-Marie Anton said it has already released the ""the poll's full demographics, crosstabs, weighted and unclose data, as well as a technical explanation from pollster Ann Selzer.""The Harris poll was no'miss' but rather an attempt to influence the outcome of the 2024 presidential election,"" the lawsuit reads.",Negative

Luigi Mangione faces first-degree murder charge in death of healthcare CEO The suspect faces first-degree murder and second-degree murder charges in the killing of CEO Brian Thompson.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3rq479z44do,"– Luigi Mangione has been charged with first-degree murder in the killing of healthcare CEO Brian Thompson, the New York district attorney said on Tuesday.Mr Mangione faces various charges, including first-degree murder, and two counts of second-degree murder, one of which describes the killing as an act of ""terrorism"", Bragg said.""The intent was to sow terror,"" New York District Attorney Alvin Bragg said, calling the shooting a ""frightening, well-planned, and targeted murder.""Mr Mangione is scheduled to appear for a court hearing on 19 December over whether he will be extradited to New York on the charges, though Bragg suggested the suspect may not fight extradition.Mr Mangione was arrested at a McDonald's in Altoona, Pennsylvania, with a fake ID and so-called ""ghost gun"", police said.Mr Mangione's lawyer, Thomas Dickey, has said he has not seen evidence that links Mr Mangione's gun with the crime.Mr Mangione's mother said she did not identify her son as the suspect, but said ""it might be something that she could see him doing.""Mr Mangione was formally charged in Pennsylvania with forgery, carrying firearms without a license, tampering with records or identification, possessing instruments of crime, and providing a false identification to police.Mr Mangione was arrested at a McDonald's in Altoona, Pennsylvania, with a fake ID and so-called ""ghost gun"", police said.Mr Mangione's lawyer, Thomas Dickey, has said he has not seen evidence that links Mr Mangione's gun with the crime.Mr Mangione's mother filed a missing person report for her son in San Francisco.",Negative
Four paths Trudeau can take as his leadership faces scrutiny A shock high-profile resignation has forced Canada's prime minister to contend with his plummeting popularity.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn54elwep72o,"– Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's future looks uncertain following the sudden resignation of his most senior cabinet member, a once close ally. Chrystia Freeland—the former deputy prime minister and finance minister—quit her posts on Monday with an open letter to Trudeau, in which she outlined disagreements she had with him on spending and ""the best path forward for Canada.""These disagreements, she said, were underscored by the threat of tariffs on Canadian goods from incoming US President Donald Trump— tariffs that economists say could deal Canada a devastating economic blow.Trudeau told fellow Liberal members of parliament (MPs)—including some who had directly called for him to step down—that he would take time to reflect, according to multiple reports.Parliament was most recently prorogued by Trudeau in August 2020, when his government was facing an ethics scandal over its handling of a contract with a charity.It was also used to avoid a no-confidence vote by Trudeau's predecessor, Conservative Prime Minister Stephen Harper, who prorogued parliament in December 2008 when federal opposition parties sought to form a coalition government. Trudeau has been leader of the Liberal Party of Canada since 2013, and Canada's prime minister for just over nine years, since 2015.Under the party's constitution, the leader can tender his or her resignation at any time.Trudeau could also choose to stay in his post until that new leader is elected.Once a new leader is appointed, Trudeau would have to relinquish his prime ministerial powers and hand them over to his successor. Trudeau has been under pressure since the summer, due to his plummeting approval ratings and a series of special election losses of once-safe Liberal seats that suggest major troubles for his party.",Negative
How Facebook restricted news in Palestinian territories,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c786wlxz4jgo,"– Facebook has severely restricted the ability of Palestinian news outlets to reach an audience during the Israel-Gaza war, according to BBC research.In a comprehensive analysis of Facebook data, we found that newsrooms in the Palestinian territories—in Gaza and the West Bank—had suffered a steep drop in audience engagement since October 2023.The BBC has also seen leaked documents showing that Instagram—another Meta-owned platform—increased its moderation of Palestinian user comments after October 2023.Meta—the owner of Facebook—says that any implication that it deliberately suppressed particular voices is ""unequivocally false.""We acknowledge we make mistakes, but any implication that we deliberately suppress a particular voice is unequivocally false,"" a spokesperson said.Over the past year, Palestinian journalists have raised fears that their online content is being ""shadow-banned"" by Meta—in other words, restricted in how many people see it.To test this, we carried out the same analysis on Facebook pages for 30 prominent Arabic-language news sources based elsewhere, such as Sky News Arabia and Al-Jazeera.However, these pages saw an average increase in engagement of nearly 100%. Meta has previously been accused by Palestinians and human rights groups of failing to moderate online activity fairly.The tech giant also said that pages posting exclusively about the war were more likely to see engagement impacted.",Negative
Syria mass graves: Daunting task of searching for and naming the dead,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cj90wz8weymo,"– The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights has concluded that more than 80,000 of the missing are dead. Another 60,000 people are believed to have been tortured to death, according to the UK-based war monitor the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR).Local people are reporting more and more locations of mass graves across Syria, and the Syrian Emergency Task Force (SETF), a US-based NGO, says that nearly 100,000 bodies have so far been found.One local resident, who witnessed the burial of bodies over the years of Syria's civil war, says they were packed in refrigerated containers brought in by security forces.The secret police prevented people from passing by mass grave sites or even looking out from their windows when they carried out the burial, another witness who was forced to take part told me.At another site in Husseiniyeh, on the road that leads to the Damascus airport, satellite images show differences in the landscapes of areas where mass graves have been discovered.",Negative
