Landmark $300bn for poorer nations in COP29 climate deal A deal is salvaged at the UN summit as poorer nations are promised record funding for climate action.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cd0gx4przejo,"– Delegates from almost 200 countries have wrapped up a two-week summit on climate change in Azerbaijan with a deal to keep global temperatures from rising 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) over pre-industrial times—but with the largest economy on the planet now unlikely to play a part, it will become harder to meet the multi-billion dollar goal.Richer countries have pledged to give a record $300bn (£238bn) to the developing world to help them prepare for and prevent climate change.The talks at the UN climate summit COP29 in Azerbaijan ran 33 hours late, and came within inches of collapse.The head of the UN climate body, Simon Stiell, said it had ""been a difficult journey, but we've delivered a deal.""But the talks failed to build on an agreement passed last year calling for nations to ""transition away from fossil fuels."" Developing nations, as well as countries that are particularly vulnerable to climate change, dramatically walked out of the talks on Saturday afternoon.This promise of more money is a recognition that poorer nations bear a disproportionate burden from climate change, but also have historically contributed the least to the climate crisis.The newly-promised money is expected to come from government grants and the private sector— banks and businesses—and should help countries move away from fossil fuel power to using renewable energy.The host nation, Azerbaijan, was a controversial choice for climate talks.Despite their hopes that the agreement struck at the talks in Dubai last year to 'transition away from fossil fuels' would be strengthened, the final proposed agreement only repeated it.For many nations this was just not good enough, and it was rejected—it will now have to be agreed next year.Countries that rely on oil and gas exports reportedly put up a strong fight in negotiations to stop further progress.",Positive

"Trump nominates Bessent to lead US Treasury in flurry of announcements He also announces nominees for labour secretary, housing secretary and surgeon general.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cj3mv6l1ypyo,"– Donald Trump has nominated Scott Bessent to lead the US Treasury Department, one of the most influential roles in government with wide oversight of tax policy, public debt, international finance and sanctions. Bessent, a Wall Street financier who once worked for George Soros, was an early backer of Trump's 2024 bid and brings a relatively conventional resume to the role.The 62-year-old's nomination on Friday evening kicked-off a series of cabinet announcements and White House appointments that leaves Trump's top team almost complete ahead of his return to the presidency in January. Bessent has made it well known that he wants to extend tax cuts made in Mr Trump's first term in office.He has also defended the use of import tariffs, one of the more controversial parts of the president-elect's campaign agenda, calling them a ""useful negotiating tool.""If his nomination to lead the Treasury department is confirmed by the Senate, Bessent would almost immediately be plunged into the fight in Washington over extending the tax cuts from Trump's first term. Trump also nominated Republican Congresswoman Lori Chavez-DeRemer for US Labor Secretary on Friday, saying she would help to ""grow wages and improve working conditions [and] bring back our manufacturing jobs.""",Positive

But as other members of her family have taken the stand, it has become painfully clear that no-one has emerged unscathed from the storm unleashed by the actions of the Pelicot patriarch.The damage to this family is clear.Gisle Pelicot has attended almost all of this trial.Dominique Pelicot was finally caught after an alert security guard caught him filming under women's skirts.But it took weeks for police to discover the full truth that ultimately tore his family apart.The magnitude of Dominique Pelicot's betrayal and crimes is such that the aftershocks have rippled far beyond his ex-wife.The Pelicots' middle child, Caroline Darian, now 45, screamed her at her father in court as she demanded to know the truth about photos found on his computer.Mr Pelicot has offered various and at times contradictory explanations for the pictures, although he has denied abusing his daughter.The videos leave no doubt that the sex acts were not consensual.Gisle Pelicot can be seen lying on the bed, snoring, as her husband whispers instructions to various men to touch her, prod her, use her. artificial sleep affords her mind a degree of protection, but her body becomes an object.Mr Pelicot has offered various and at times contradictory explanations for the pictures, although he has denied abusing his daughter.He said he would seek out a paternity test, adding it would be a ""relief"" not to be Dominique Pelicot's son.When Caroline's brothers David and Florian took the stand they made repeated references to the pain she was going through, urging their father to tell the truth.",Negative
Just how large was Trump’s election win? The US president-elect has emphasised the scale of his win – but data shows that most voters picked someone else.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn5w9w160xdo,"– President-elect Donald Trump has said his election victory handed him an ""unprecedented and powerful"" mandate to govern.He beat Democratic rival Kamala Harris in all seven closely watched swing states, giving him a decisive advantage overall.Trump's party has also won both chambers of Congress, giving the returning president considerable power to enact his agenda.But the data suggests it was a much closer contest than he and his supporters are suggesting.His communications director Steven Cheung has called it a ""landslide"" victory.Yet it emerged this week that his share of the vote has fallen below 50%, as counting continues.It feels grandiose to me that they're calling it a landslide,"" said Chris Jackson, senior vice-president in the US team of polling firm Ipsos.Trump's win of both the popular vote and the presidency can be seen as an improvement on his last victory eight years ago.But Trump cannot say that he won the outright majority of the presidential votes that were cast in the election overall.To do so, he would need to have won more than 50%, as all victors have done for the last 20 years—other than Trump in 2016.",Positive

'Are we not humans?': Anger in Beirut as massive Israeli strike kills 20 The death toll from the strike on a multi-storey building in central Beirut's Basta district is expected to rise.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy8ne9757jdo,"– A massive Israeli air strike on central Beirut has killed at least 20 people, Lebanese officials say, in the latest attack on the capital amid an escalation of Israel's campaign against Hezbollah.The strike happened without warning at about 04:00 (02:00 GMT) on Saturday, and was an attempt to assassinate a senior Hezbollah official, Israeli media reported.The attack was heard and felt across the city, and destroyed at least one eight-story residential building in the densely populated Basta district.Israel has intensified its campaign against Hezbollah, the Iran-backed militia and political movement, amid international efforts for a ceasefire, in what appears to be a strategy to pressure the group to accept a deal.The escalation comes as renewed negotiations to end more than one year of conflict showed initial signs of progress.Israel's stated goal in its war against Hezbollah is to allow the return of about 60,000 residents who have been displaced from communities in northern Israel because of the group's attacks.Both Hezbollah and Iran have indicated being interested in a deal, according to a senior Lebanese source.Since the conflict intensified in late September, Lebanese authorities have said any deal should be limited to the terms of United Nations Security Council Resolution 1701, which ended the 2006 war between Hezbollah and Israel.The resolution includes the withdrawal of Hezbollah's fighters and weapons in areas between the Blue Line—the unofficial frontier between Lebanon and Israel—and the Litani river, about 20 miles from the boundary with Israel.Israel says that was never fully respected, while Lebanon says Israeli violations included military flights over Lebanese territory.",Negative
'Refused service yet again with my guide dog - I'm done speaking out',https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c87x2p535wqo,"– As a guide dog handler of 25 and a half years, I've had hundreds of experiences of being refused service—but online threats and increasing hostility towards disabled people mean I'm giving up on asking publicly for equality and respect.The last straw came about a week ago.I visited the restaurant, which I have chosen not to name, but was told I couldn't enter as people could have allergies.It's difficult to describe how this feels.I don't think you can understand it unless you know what it is like to face daily discrimination.I compare the feeling to December 2022 when I was briefly robbed of my smartphone near the BBC building in central London.Unlike street robberies, refusals are rarely violent or physical, but the feeling of being slugged in the gut is identical.I have never understood why, when everyone on the planet is one accident or medical condition away from disability, many people seem to lack any empathy and do not attempt to understand how it must feel to be refused service because of a disability.I would reply to as many questions as possible and explain that it was simply to shine a torch into a dark corner.On other occasions, social media users have threatened to punch me, kill my guide dog and tell me I need to 'be careful.'""",Negative
"No 'red lines' in Ukraine support, French foreign minister tells BBC",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/czd5myvyrjzo,"– France's foreign minister has told the BBC that Ukraine could fire French long-range missiles into Russia ""in the logics of self defense"", but would not confirm if French weapons had already been used.""The principle has been set... our messages to President Zelensky have been well received,"" he said in an exclusive interview for Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg.French President Macron indicated France's willingness to allow its missiles to be fired into Russia earlier this year.But Barrot's comments are significant, coming days after US and UK long-range missiles were used in that way for the first time.Asked if this could even mean French troops in combat he said: ""We do not discard any option.""""We will support Ukraine as intensely and as long as necessary.Why? Because it is our security that is at stake.Intelligence we can reveal this weekend shows Ukraine used drones in mid and late September to hit four Russian ammunition depots, hundreds of miles from Ukraine.The hope is to put Ukraine in the best possible position for any negotiation, several sources said, and an insider advising the government told me that might involve bigging up Trump's own negotiation ability.It's not surprising there's a strong feeling in the defense world that increasing defense budgets is part of the answer.One UK government source describes the moment as ""crunch point"" ahead of the winter, and ahead of Donald Trump's return to the White House.",Positive
