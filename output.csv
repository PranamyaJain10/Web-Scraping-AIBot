Daniel Penny is guest of Trump and Vance at football game Mr Penny was acquitted earlier this week of homicide after a homeless man died when he restrained him on a subway.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy09k15l21ro,"– A New York City subway rider who was acquitted this week of killing a homeless man during a confrontation on a train has joined US President-elect Donald Trump as a guest of honor at a popular American sporting event.Daniel Penny, who became a conservative cause celebre, was pictured attending the Army v Navy American football game near Washington DC with Trump and Vice-President-elect JD Vance.A jury cleared Mr Penny of criminally negligent homicide on Monday for using a fatal chokehold to restrain Jordan Neely, a 30-year-old homeless man, who had been shouting at other passengers and asking for money, last year.The May 2023 subway incident sparked protests across New York and reignited debates over public transportation safety and how the city cares for those struggling with mental health issues and homelessness.Speaking about Mr Penny's acquittal earlier this week, Vance said this week on X that Mr Penny was ""a good guy, and New York's mob district attorney tried to ruin his life for having a backbone.""If it were a president in office who was a Democrat, who invited him to the Army-Navy game as a way to show support to the military and for his country, he would have gladly accepted that as well,"" Mr Penny's lawyer, Steven Raiser, said in a statement that his client was honored by the invitation to Saturday's game.""He's not viewing it as a political statement.Mr Penny's lawyer previously described that legal action as a distraction.Mr Penny's lawyer previously described that legal action as a distraction.",Positive
Skulls and body bags: Searching for Syria's disappeared BBC's Lucy Williamson finds family members exhuming human remains in a desperate search for their lost relatives.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cr4rz5169q9o,"– Bashar al-Assad's fall has unleashed a tsunami of hope from families who were left for decades without any way of finding out what happened to their loved ones.""If you ever came past here [in Assad's time], you couldn't stop, you couldn't look up,"" Khaled said. ""Cars used to speed past. If you stopped, they would come to you, put a plastic bag on your head and take you away.""Tens of thousands of families like his are now searching for relatives who disappeared into Assad's notorious prison system, or into its military interrogation centers.Some were taken to the Mazzeh military airbase in Damascus.This site, once a key buffer between Assad and rebel forces, is deserted.The only thing more painful than finding your parent or child among the records here is not finding them at all.Human rights groups have accused the UK government of turning a blind eye to the US practice during the so-called war on terror, when America sent detainees to several countries in the Middle East, including Syria.Assad's regime was meticulous in documenting its brutality—a vast bureaucracy of terror that makes the scale of its actions all too clear, but in which the stories of individuals are often lost or submerged.The lack of any ordered system means critical evidence is being lost each day at sites across Syria—information about the missing, but also potentially, any links between Assad's regime and foreign governments like the US or the UK, both of which have been accused of benefitting from the American policy of extraordinary rendition, in which terrorist suspects were sent for interrogation to countries that used torture.",Negative

We fight FROM victory, not FOR victory. This was over before it began.This 1-800 lawyer doesn't realize it yet, but, soon.""A lawyer for Mr Combs said in a statement sent to the BBC: ""Today, for the second time this week, a Buzbee plaintiff has been exposed.This is the beginning of the end of this shameful money grab.""",Negative
"Tracing the powerful family roots of suspected killer Luigi Mangione In his home city, the accused shooter's family name has meant wealth, power, prominence and philanthropy for decades.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/crl3jkjxp75o,"– This week, the surname Mangione became associated with the killing of health-insurance executive Brian Thompson in New York City, when 26-year-old Luigi Mangione was charged with his murder.But for decades, the name has meant something entirely different: wealth, power, prominence, philanthropy—particularly within the Italian community of Baltimore.They're one of, if not the, ""most respected"" Italian families in the area, according to Giovanna Aquia Blatterman.Now 77, Ms Aquia Blatterman, who arrived in the US from Sicily in1953, said she has known three generations of Mangiones.The family is ""generous"" and ""self-made"", she said, while Luigi, who she met briefly about eight years ago, appeared clever, approachable and handsome—""as you can tell"".""Something has occurred with him,"" she mused, referencing the last several days.Asked to talk to family members were met either with no response or a firm, but polite: ""No comment.""Dylan Segelbaum, a reporter for local news website the Baltimore Banner, said that as Luigi Mangione grew up, his family owned businesses ranging from country clubs and golf courses to assisted living facilities.The family patriarch—who long ago had moved his expanding family out to the suburbs—died in 2008, leaving behind 10 children, and 37 grandchildren, including Luigi Mangione.When he was arrested, police say Luigi Mangione was carrying a hand-written document detailing his alleged ""ill will"" towards corporate elites, which US media have reported included the line ""these parasites had it coming.""",Negative

She had no idea that, in his late 50s and nearing retirement, her husband Dominique Pelicot had been spending a lot of time on the internet, often talking to users on open forums and chatrooms where sexual material—often extreme or illegal—was freely available.In court, he would later pinpoint that phase as the trigger for his ""perversion"" after a childhood trauma of rape and abuse: ""We become perverted when we find something that gives us the means: the internet.""Between 2010 and 2011, a man claiming to be a nurse sent Mr Pelicot photos of his wife, drugged with sleeping pills to the point of unconsciousness.He also shared precise instructions with Mr Pelicot so that he could do the same to Gisle.At first he hesitated—but not for long.Through trial and error he realized that with the right dosage of pills he could plunge his wife into a sleep so deep nothing would wake her.As the years went by, the effects of the abuse Ms Pelicot was subjected to at night increasingly began to seep into her waking life.Her family became worried.He kept tranquilisers in a shoebox in the garage, and switched brands because the first tasted ""too salty"" to be surreptitiously added to his wife's food and drink, he said later.On a chatroom called ""without her knowledge"" he recruited men of all ages to come and abuse his wife.He told the court his wife's unconscious state was clear to the 71 men who came to their house over the course of a decade.As the years went by, the effects of the abuse Ms Pelicot was subjected to at night increasingly began to seep into her waking life.She lost weight, clumps of hair fell out and her blackouts became more frequent.Her family became more frequent.",Negative
