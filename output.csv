"Russia vows 'tangible' response if US missiles used against its territory US approval for Ukraine to strike inside Russia is a key move in the war as it reaches its 1,000th day.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/crr91nn9n79o,"– Russia says the use of US long-range missiles by Ukraine will lead to ""an appropriate and tangible"" response.Such an attack inside Russian territory ""would represent the direct involvement of the United States and its satellites in hostilities against Russia"", a foreign ministry statement said.President Joe Biden approved the use of the missiles on targets in Russia in a major change of US policy - two months before he is due to leave the White House.It is not clear if his successor, President-elect Donald Trump, was consulted or whether he will stick by the decision, having promised to end the Russia-Ukraine war.Ukraine has had US ATACMS with a range of 300km (190 miles) - as well as French and British Storm Shadow missiles of a similar range - but the Western allies had barred Kyiv from hitting Russia with them. Biden's decision to lift that condition is a significant moment in the war, which marks its 1,000th day on Tuesday.Moscow has now intensified attacks on Ukrainian infrastructure as the sides appear to have reached a stalemate on the battlefield.The US decision also follows the arrival in Russia's Kursk region—where Ukrainian forces captured and are holding onto a small piece of territory—of more than 10,000 troops from North Korea to help President Vladimir Putin's forces.Unconfirmed reports say North Korea may send as many as 100,000 soldiers, in addition to artillery and other weapons to its ally. Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky has indicated there may be no formal announcement of the US deal—""the missiles will speak for themselves""—but Jon Finer, US deputy national security adviser, said Washington had made it ""clear to the Russians that we would respond""—both to the presence of North Korean forces and the ""major escalation"" in Russian aerial attacks on infrastructure across Ukraine.",Negative
Biden's move on missiles for Ukraine angers Trump allies It is not clear if Biden's decision will be endorsed by Donald Trump who has promised to end the Ukraine war.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cdrdmkxy7xmo,"– President Joe Biden's apparent green light for Ukraine to strike Russia with US-made long-range missiles has caused consternation among some of Donald Trump's allies.Trump himself has not commented, but he won the election after promising to end the war—and several people close to him have condemned the move as dangerous escalation.Biden has committed tens of billions of dollars to Kyiv's war effort, and at the weekend he reportedly ditched a long-standing red line on Ukraine's use of American weaponry to launch attacks deep into Russia.Donald Trump Jr tweeted that the president was trying to ""get World War Three going"" before his father took office.My criticism of Biden is the same as every other conservative and supporter of Trump - which is that the Biden administration slow walked this,"" he said.Gilmore said he did not know what the president-elect would choose to do regarding Ukraine once he entered office. Polls suggest a large number of Republicans want US support for Ukraine to stop— 62% told a poll by Pew Research the US had no responsibility to support the country against Russia.Senator JD Vance, who will be Trump's vice-president, has regularly objected to providing arms to Ukraine.He argued that the US lacks the manufacturing capacity to continue providing weapons like the missile systems that Kyiv will use to strike within Russia.Gilmore, however, said the US was able to backfill and upgrade its weapon systems through this process, but he said the US's European allies would need to take on a bigger role.When asked about how typical it would be for a presidential administration to take such a significant policy decision in its final months, State Department spokesman Matthew Miller said Biden was ""elected to a four-year-term, not a term of three years and 10 months.",Negative

"Trump defence pick paid accuser to save Fox News job, but denies claim Pete Hegseth maintains he is innocent and says the sexual encounter in 2017 was consensual.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3vl63pzpwzo,"– President-elect Donald Trump's pick to serve as defense secretary paid a woman who accused him of sexual assault to stay quiet so he would not risk losing his job at Fox News, his lawyer has told the BBC's US partner CBS News.Pete Hegseth, a host at Fox, denies any wrongdoing and says the sexual encounter was consensual.His lawyer told CBS that Hegseth paid a confidential financial settlement as he feared he would be sacked from his job at the news network.The agreement deterred the woman from moving forward with a lawsuit, the lawyer added.The lawyer, Timothy Parlatore, explained that the the woman and her attorney knew that filing a lawsuit ""would cause an immediate horror storm for [Hegseth]"".""The reality is that, had they filed [a lawsuit], civil process takes quite a while, and so Fox News likely would have fired him based on the allegation,"" he told CBS.The woman filed a complaint in 2017 with the Monterey Police Department, alleging that she had been assaulted by Hegseth at the Hyatt Regency Monterey Hotel and Spa.The Washington Post first reported Hegseth's payment to the woman and obtained a memo sent to Trump's transition team from a friend of the accuser.The 44-year-old veteran will be responsible for the world's most powerful military in his first political role, if confirmed by the US Senate.",Negative

"Almost 100 Gaza food aid lorries violently looted, UN agency says Drivers in Saturday's convoy were forced at gunpoint to unload their food supplies, according to Unrwa.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5ypjd7gepmo,"– A convoy of 109 UN aid lorries carrying food was violently looted in Gaza on Saturday, the UN agency for Palestinian refugees (Unrwa) says.Ninety-seven of the lorries were lost and their drivers were forced at gunpoint to unload their aid after passing through the Israeli-controlled Kerem Shalom crossing with southern Gaza, in what is believed to have been one of the worst incidents of its kind.Eyewitnesses said the convoy was attacked by masked men who threw grenades.Unrwa commissioner general Philippe Lazzarini did not identify the perpetrators, but he said the ""total breakdown of civil order"" in Gaza meant it had ""become an impossible environment to operate in.""It came after Israeli forces launched a major ground offensive in the north and the UN said fewer aid lorries had entered Gaza last month than at any time since the start of the war between Israel and Hamas in October 2023. Saturday's looting was first reported by Reuters news agency, which cited an Unrwa official in Gaza as saying that the convoy was instructed by Israeli authorities to ""depart at short notice via an unfamiliar route"" from Kerem Shalom.Gaza's Hamas-run interior ministry said its security staff killed ""more than 20 members of gangs involved in stealing aid trucks"" in an operation carried out in cooperation with ""tribal committees"", a network of traditional family clans.Lazzarini said he could not comment on the route when asked at a news conference in Geneva on Monday, but he confirmed the looting and said: ""We have been warning a long time ago about the total breakdown of civil order.""Until four or five months ago, we still had local capacity, people who were escorting the convoy.This has completely gone, which means we are in an environment where local gangs, local families, are struggling among each other to take control of any business or any activities taking place in the south.It has become an impossible environment to operate in.""",Negative
The activists facing jail in Hong Kong's largest national security case Pro-democracy icons such as Joshua Wong and Benny Tai will be sentenced in the controversial case.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c722wq7rgqgo,"– A court will hand out jail sentences for some of Hong Kong's biggest pro-democracy icons, including Joshua Wong and Benny Tai, in a controversial national security case.They are part of a group known as the Hong Kong 47 who were charged three years ago in a crackdown under the national security law (NSL) imposed by China.Officials accused the eight women and 39 men of trying to overthrow the government by running an unofficial primary to pick opposition candidates for the Legislative Council (LegCo) election.Held in July 2020, the primary was aimed at helping the opposition gain a large enough foothold to block the pro-Beijing government's bills.The primary was seen as a way of continuing the pro-democracy movement after the 2019 protests dwindled with the pandemic.It alarmed Beijing and Hong Kong officials, who warned that the move could breach the NSL, which came into effect days before the primary.Most of the defendants either pleaded guilty or were convicted of conspiring to attempt subversion.Two were acquitted in May, which means 45 people will receive their sentences on Tuesday.Some are famous figures such as Joshua Wong and Benny Tai, icons of the 2014 pro-democracy protests that rocked Hong Kong.A scholar and law professor, Benny Tai first rose to prominence in 2014 when he founded the pro-democracy Occupy Central movement along with two others.It was a historic civil disobedience campaign that called for fair and free elections in Hong Kong and saw hundreds of thousands take to the streets.The two acquitted are Laurence Lau, a barrister and former district councillor, and Lee Yue-shun, also a former district councillor.Most of the defendants have been in jail since the arrests in early 2021.",Positive
A family froze to death at the US-Canada border. Two accused smugglers face trial,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c14lryd33y1o,"– It was a backpack with child's clothing and toys that first worried US Border Patrol agents. That winter morning in January 2022, after a fierce blizzard, authorities had arrested a man driving a van near the US-Canada border, suspecting him of smuggling migrants. Along with the driver, border guards picked up seven Indian nationals. A family with two children had been with the other migrants as they made their way across the border at night, border agents were told, but they had become separated. A search was launched and Canadian police found the bodies of Vaishaliben Patel, her husband Jagdish and their two young children, 11-year-old Vihangi and 3-year-old Dharmik, in a Manitoba field just 12m (39ft) from the US border.It is believed that the family—who had traveled on visitor visas from their home village in western India to Toronto, Canada—were trying to cross into the US when they were caught in the blinding blizzard with a bone-chilling cold that hovered below -35C (-31F). Harshkumarlal Patel (who is not related to the deceased family) and Steve Anthony Shand are accused of helping them make the fatal journey.They each face charges of human trafficking, criminal conspiracy and culpable homicide not amounting to murder in the US state of Minnesota, with their trial set to begin on Monday with jury selection. Court documents filed in the case reveal an alleged complex, global web behind human smuggling operations that are designed to get foreign nationals into North America.",Negative
