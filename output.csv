"Iran leader says US gained nothing from strikes as Hegseth hails 'historic success' The ayatollah speaks for the first time since the conflict ended, as the US insists Iran's nuclear sites are destroyed.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cdjxy039ln8o,"– Iran's supreme leader has insisted the US ""gained no achievements"" from strikes on its nuclear facilities, in his first public address since a ceasefire with Israel was agreed on Tuesday.Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said the strikes did not ""accomplish anything significant"" to disrupt Iran's nuclear program, and described the retaliation against an American air base in Qatar as dealing a ""heavy blow.""It came as Washington doubled down on its assessment that the strikes had severely undermined Iran's nuclear ambitions.US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said intelligence gathered by the US and Israel indicated the operation ""significantly damaged the nuclear program, setting it back by years.""Khamenei used Thursday's video address to threaten to carry out more strikes on US bases in the Middle East if Iran was attacked again, and declared victory over both Israel and the US.The US became directly involved last weekend, striking facilities in Fordo, Natanz and Isfahan, before Trump sought to rapidly mediate a ceasefire between Israel and Iran, which has held since.UN nuclear watchdog chief Rafael Grossi said on Wednesday that there was a chance Tehran had moved much of its highly enriched uranium elsewhere as it came under attack. Khamenei said Trump had ""exaggerated"" the impact of the nuclear site strikes, adding: ""They couldn't accomplish anything and did not achieve their objective.""",Negative
Iran carries out wave of arrests and executions in wake of Israel conflict Iranian authorities have carried out arrests and executions of people suspected of links to Israeli intelligence agencies.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ce8zv8j563po,"– Iranian authorities have carried out a wave of arrests and multiple executions of people suspected of links to Israeli intelligence agencies, in the wake of the recent war between the two countries.It comes after what officials describe as an unprecedented infiltration of Iranian security services by Israeli agents.Iran's Ministry of Intelligence claims it is engaged in a ""relentless battle"" against what it calls Western and Israeli intelligence networks—including the CIA, Mossad, and MI6.According to Fars News Agency, which is affiliated with the IRGC, since the beginning of Israel's attack on Iran on 13 June, ""the Israeli spy network has become highly active inside the country.""During the 12-day conflict, Iranian authorities executed three people accused of spying for Israel.On Wednesday—just one day after the ceasefire—three more individuals were executed on similar charges.Officials have since announced the arrest of hundreds of suspects across the country on accusations of espionage.Human rights advocates and political observers have drawn parallels to the 1980s, when the Iranian authorities brutally suppressed political opposition during the Iran-Iraq War.Many fear that, in the wake of its weakened international standing after the conflict with Israel, the Iranian authorities may again turn inward, resorting to mass arrests, executions, and heavy-handed repression.",Negative
"Rising school fees push Indian families to the brink Many parents are accusing private schools of steep fee raises which, they say, are stretching budgets to breaking point.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c2le1l0pv95o,"– ""Two or three minutes after I entered the class, guards and bouncers asked me to leave the room,"" Amis recalls. His father was still standing outside the school gates when Amis was asked to get on the school bus, which dropped them off at their homes.Over the past two months, protests have erupted across Indian cities—from Delhi to Pune to Hyderabad—as a growing number parents accuse private schools of imposing steep fee increases.In Delhi, rules say that private schools on government-leased land must get Directorate of Education (DoE) approval before raising fees and must admit 25% economically weaker or disadvantaged students—a condition tied to their subsidised leases.The BBC has contacted the DoE for comment on the fee rises, which parents have reported to us, but has not received a response.A's case is not an isolated one and DPS is not the only school which is facing allegations of arbitrary fee increase.",Positive

"The woman who could bust Trump's 'big beautiful bill' The Senate parliamentarian, often called a referee, has thrown a spanner in Trump's tax bill.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx2498ekj21o,"– The Senate parliamentarian's job is to decide whether a bill complies with budget rules. Ms MacDonough—the first woman to hold the role—has held the position since 2012. Earlier this month, the House of Representatives narrowly passed a massive spending bill that included cuts to low-income health insurance program Medicaid, reforms to the food assistance program SNAP, and a measure to end taxes on tips and overtime pay.That version then went to the Senate, where both Republicans and Democrats wanted adjustments made.Texas Senator John Cornyn said Republicans should not let ""an unelected Senate staffer"" stop the party from passing the bill.The 1,000-page document, which he's dubbed the ""big beautiful bill"", would slash spending and extend tax cuts.Ms MacDonough has said that certain provisions violate Senate rules, throwing billions of dollars of cuts into doubt.Republicans maintain a majority in both the House and the Senate, which should make it easy to pass legislation.But Senate Republican Leader John Thune, of South Dakota, does not seem to agree with calls to oust her.Thune, who is the chief spokesperson for the party in the chamber, told reporters on Capitol Hill on Thursday he would not overrule Ms MacDonough.Instead, he described the senate referee's rulings as ""speed bumps.""",Positive
"Ukrainian forces halt Russian advance in Sumy region, says army chief Russia launched its offensive in the spring aiming to create a ""buffer zone"" inside Ukraine to protect its border regions.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cz093jn819po,"– The head of Ukraine's army, Gen Oleksandr Syrskyi, has said his troops have stopped Russian advances in the northeastern border region of Sumy. During a visit to the front on Thursday, Syrskyi said the line of combat had been ""stabilised"" and that the Russian summer offensive in the area had been ""choked off.""However, Syrskyi also added that he had personally gone to check on fortifications in the region and that more were urgently needed.Syrskyi's comments on the successes of the Ukrainian troops in Sumy back recent statements by Ukrainian officials that Russia's pressure on the region was declining.Sumy borders the Russian region of Kursk, parts of which were seized and occupied last year by Ukrainian forces in a surprise offensive before being almost totally driven out months later.The Kursk incursion was an embarrassment for Russia and in April President Vladimir Putin announced a plan to create ""security buffer zones"" along the border to provide ""additional support"" to areas in Russia which border Ukraine's Kharkiv, Sumy, and Chernihiv regions.The window of opportunity to build fortifications in Sumy safely and quickly was in autumn 2024, when Ukrainian troops were still advancing in the Russia's border Kursk region and Sumy remained relatively unscathed.Syrskyi tried to quell growing public concerns over delays in their construction.",Positive
