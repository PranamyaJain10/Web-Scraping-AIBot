In the wake of this violence, California's feckless Democrat leaders have completely abdicated their responsibility to protect their citizens. That is why President Trump has signed a Presidential Memorandum deploying 2,000 National Guardsmen to address the lawlessness that has been allowed to fester.""Speaking in Los Angeles, where he had traveled to personally supervise the continuing ICE operations, Homan said: ""We're bringing in more resources as we speak. We gonna bring the National Guard in tonight. We gonna continue doing our job.""He warned that there would be ""zero tolerance"" of any violence or damage to private property.The US president has the authority to deploy the National Guard for certain purposes which include ""suppressing rebellion.""But responding on Saturday, California's governor said the federal government's move to ""take over the California National Guard and deploy 2,000 soldiers"" was ""purposefully inflammatory"" and would ""only escalate tensions.""LA authorities are able to access law enforcement assistance at a moment's notice,"" Newsom added.",Negative
"Six killed by Israeli gunfire near Gaza aid site, Hamas officials say Dozens of Palestinians have been killed close to the controversial supply centre in Gaza.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy5evz4xdklo,"– Six Palestinians have been killed and several others wounded by Israeli gunfire in the latest deadly incident close to an aid distribution center in southern Gaza, the Hamas-run Civil Defense agency says.People had gathered to collect food supplies on Saturday morning when the shooting started, a spokesman for the agency said. Reports quoting an eyewitness said the Israelis opened fire when people tried to advance towards the site.The Israeli military said it fired warning shots at suspects who approached them in a threatening manner.The US and Israeli-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) which runs the center says it has paused its operations to deal with overcrowding and improve safety.But people have gathered nearly every day at a roundabout on the edge of an Israeli military zone, through which they have to pass to reach the aid site.In a statement, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said they had told Gazans the area was an active combat zone during nighttime hours.GHF said it had not been able to distribute food on Saturday because of direct threats from Hamas - something the group has denied.Whatever the case, the new incident will almost certainly strengthen international criticism of the new distribution model.The United Nations insists it puts Palestinians in danger and does not provide enough food and medicine to deal with Gaza's humanitarian crisis.",Negative

Doctors try 'poo pills' to flush out dangerous superbugs Can a dose of good bacteria clear superbugs from their hiding place in the bowels?,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clyge290l4xo,"– Doctors are attempting to clear dangerous superbug infections using ""poo pills"" containing freeze-dried faeces.The stool samples come from healthy donors and are packed with good bacteria.Early data suggests superbugs can be flushed out of the dark murky depths of the bowel and replaced with a mix of healthy gut bacteria.It is a new approach to tackling infections that resist antibiotics, which are thought to kill a million people each year.The focus is on the bowels which are ""the biggest reservoir of antibiotic resistance in humans"" says Dr Blair Merrick, who has been testing the pills at Guys and St Thomas' hospitals.Drug-resistant superbugs can escape their intestinal home and cause trouble elsewhere in the body—such as urinary tract or bloodstream infections.It showed patients were up for taking a poo pill and the donated bacteria were still being detected in the bowels at least a month later.Dr Merrick says there are ""really promising signals"" that poo pills could help tackle the rising scourge of superbugs and that donor bacteria could be going to microbial war with the superbugs as they compete over food and space on the lining of the gut and either rid the body of them completely or ""reduce them down to a level that doesn't cause problems.""It's very exciting.A lot of these individuals come to a lot of harm from drug-resistant organisms,"" Dr Merrick.The UK's drugs regulator—the Medicines and Healthcare Products Agency—said there were more than 450 microbiome medicines currently in development.",Negative

Trump-Musk row fuels 'biggest crisis ever' at Nasa The space agency has published its budget request to Congress which would see funding for science projects cut by nearly a half.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c87jq0djw00o,"– President Trump is repurposing Nasa for two things: to land astronauts on the Moon before the Chinese and to have astronauts plant a US flag on Mars. Everything else is secondary.""Those who back the proposals say the White House's budget has given Nasa a clear purpose, for the first time since the days of the Apollo Moon landings of the 1960s and 70s, when the aim was to beat the Soviet Union to the Moon.According to Casey Dreier, chief of space policy for the Pasadena-based Planetary Society, which promotes space exploration, the potential cuts represent ""the biggest crisis ever to face the US space program.""The development of these alternatives to SLS is being bankrolled by Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos.Dr Simeon Barber, a space scientist at the Open University said that the uncertainty was having a ""chilling impact"" on the human space program.""The astonishing exchanges, snap decisions and U turns we've witnessed in the last week undermine the very foundations that we build our ambitions on.""Maybe we have been too reliant on Nasa the big player to carry a lot of the emphasis in space,"" he told BBC News.""The projects facing the axe include dozens of planetary missions already in space for which most of the development and launch costs have already been paid for, with relatively small savings proposed on their operating costs.""The worry is that Nasa may be jumping out of the frying pan, into the fire,"" says Dr Barber.",Negative

Polo-loving drug lord's double life catches up with him,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c14jpymxrkno,"– On the surface, Muhammed Asif Hafeez was an upstanding individual.A global businessman and ambassador of a prestigious London polo club, he rubbed shoulders with the British elite, including members of the Royal Family.He also regularly passed on detailed information to the authorities in the UK and Middle East that, in some cases, led to the interception of huge shipments of drugs. He was motivated, he said, simply by what he saw as his ""moral obligation to curb and highlight criminal activities.""From his residence in the UK, he was the puppet-master of a vast drugs empire, supplying many tonnes of heroin, methamphetamine and hashish from bases in Pakistan and India that were distributed across the world.The BBC has closely followed Hafeez's case. He was sentenced to 16 years in a New York prison for conspiring to import drugs—including enough heroin for ""millions of doses""—into the US. Hafeez was born in September 1958 to a middle-class family in Lahore, Pakistan.One of six children, his upbringing was comfortable.He was listed as an international ambassador for the prestigious Ham Polo Club for at least three years, from 2009 to 2011.
