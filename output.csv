Trump looms over Canada's election as campaign begins The country will vote on 28 April as President Trump wages a trade war and says he wants to make Canada the 51st US state.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/crlxe4wxxj4o,"– Canada's newly appointed Prime Minister Mark Carney has called a snap election, sending the country to the polls on 28 April. The election comes as Canada faces a trade war with the US and calls from President Trump for it to become the 51st American state, issues which are expected to be top of mind for voters.It also comes nine days after Carney, a Liberal, was sworn in as Canada's prime minister following Justin Trudeau's resignation. Carney must now face Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre, whose party had been leading in national polls since mid-2023, though recent polls suggest the race is now neck-and-neck.Carney on Sunday called the trade war with the US one of the ""most significant threats of our lifetimes.""Referring to Trump, he said: 'He wants to break us so America will own us.'",Negative
Five things to look for in Canada's election Canadians will vote in April after what will be a short 36-day campaign - but possibly one of the most consequential in recent history.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c07zxy98g45o,"– Canada's general election campaign is underway, a 36-day sprint taking place in unprecedented circumstances. Voters will be mulling which party should govern the country just as the US—its neighbor and largest economic partner— launches a trade war and President Trump muses about making Canada the 51st US state. Here are five things to watch as the campaign unfolds: Who can most capably handle the unpredictable US president? The contest essentially boils down to two men: Liberal Mark Carney and Conservative Pierre Poilievre. The US president weighed in recently, telling Fox News host Laura Ingraham—without naming either major party leader—that the Conservative is ""stupidly, no friend of mine"" and that it may be ""easier to deal actually with a Liberal."" This election is about the big, national questions: Canada's sovereignty and what the country must do to face an uncertain future with uncertain allies.",Positive
India-China relations: Modi's hope for a thaw amid uncertain geopolitics India and China are natural competitors but developments in strained ties can help with easing diplomatic tensions.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cj4nkxv4e4po,"– India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi spoke positively about India's relationship with long-time rival China.These are striking comments, because tensions have been high since a nasty border clash in the northern Ladakh region in 2020—the deadliest since a 1962 war.China foreign ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning expressed appreciation for Modi's words and declared that ""the two countries should be partners that contribute to each other's success."" Modi's pitch for closer partnership isn't actually as big of a leap as it may seem, given recent improvements in bilateral ties.But the relationship remains strained, and much will need to fall into place— bilaterally and more broadly geopolitically—for it to enjoy a true rapprochement.India-China ties have many bright spots.Bilateral trade is consistently robust; even after the Ladakh clash, China has been India's top trade partner.The situation on the border is the biggest bellwether of the relationship.China has a large naval presence, and its only overseas military base, in India's broader maritime backyard.India is deepening ties with Taiwan, which China views as a renegade province.India is negotiating sales of supersonic missiles to Southeast Asian states that could be used to deter Chinese provocations in the South China Sea.China views several global forums to which India belongs, such as the Indo-Pacific Quad and the Middle East Europe Economic Corridor, as attempts to counter it.The Trump factor looms large, too.President Donald Trump, despite slapping tariffs on China, has telegraphed a desire to ease tensions with Beijing.",Positive

'I scarred my six children by using skin-lightening creams' A mother explains why she - and 77% of the country’s women - have used dangerous creams.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cj92g4n3v78o,"– A mother in northern Nigeria is visibly upset as she clutches her two-year-old child, who has burns and discoloured skin on his face and legs.The 32-year-old used skin-whitening products on all six of her children, under pressure from her family, with results that she now deeply regrets.Fatima, whose name has been changed to protect her family's identity, says one of her daughters covers her face whenever she goes out in order to hide her burns.Another was left with darker skin than before—with a pale circle around her eyes, while a third has whitish scars on her lips and knees.Her toddler still has weeping wounds—his skin is taking a long time to heal.""My sister gave birth to light-skinned children but my children are darker skinned. I noticed that my mother favors my sister's children over mine due to their skin tone and it hurt my feelings a lot,"" Fatima says.She says she used creams she bought at her local supermarket in the city of Kano, without a doctor's prescription.Skin-whitening or lightening, also known as bleaching in Nigeria, is used in different parts of the world for cosmetic reasons, though these often have deep cultural roots.Women in Nigeria use skin-whitening products more than in any other African country— 77% use them regularly, according to the UN World Health Organization (WHO).The creams may contain corticosteroids or hydroquinone, which can be harmful if used in high quantities, and in many countries are only obtainable with a doctor's prescription.Dermatitis, acne and skin discolouration are possible consequences, but also inflammatory disorders, mercury poisoning and kidney damage.The situation is so bad that Nigeria's National Agency for Food and Drug Administration and Control (Nafdac) declared a state of emergency in 2023.",Negative
"A deal in the desert?

"Chuck Schumer says he is not stepping down, as he faces growing Democratic anger",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5yx7k2znq8o,"– Chuck Schumer has said he will not step down, as anger and pressure builds among his fellow Democrats over his decision not to block a Republican-led government funding measure.""Look, I'm not stepping down,"" Schumer told NBC News' Meet the Press programme on Sunday.Some Democrats wanted Schumer to block the most recent government funding bill, which they believed enabled President Donald Trump's agenda, but Schumer decided to allow a full vote.He and a handful of other Senate Democrats voted to advance the measure to a final vote, but voted against the funding bill's ultimate passage. Schumer told Meet the Press he made his decisions ""out of pure conviction as to what a leader should do and what the right thing for America and my party was.""The Senate's top Democrat argued that blocking the bill would have caused the government to shut down, a scenario that would have handed Trump increased power to slash federal jobs and social and public services.The government funding measure was ""certainly bad,"" Schumer said. ""But a shutdown would be 15 or 20 times worse.""Yet many powerful members of his party have openly criticized Schumer's decision, arguing he threw away their limited leverage against Trump.Bernie Sanders, an Independent, said he believed the issue was with the Democratic Party writ large.He alleged the party was ""dominated by billionaires"" and was ""out of touch"" with its constituents.Pelosi speculated that Schumer could have tried to get Republicans to agree to a ""third way.""I myself don't give away anything for nothing,"" former US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said at an event in San Francisco last week.",Positive
