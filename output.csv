Constellation chief executive Joe Dominguez told analysts on Friday that the deal was a ""powerful symbol of the rebirth of nuclear power as a clean and reliable energy resource.""Before it was prematurely shuttered due to poor economics, this plant was among the safest and most reliable nuclear plants on the grid, and we look forward to bringing it back with a new name and a renewed mission.""",Positive
