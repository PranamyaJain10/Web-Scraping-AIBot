Trump has turned his back on the foundation of US economic might - the fallout will be messy What made the US step back from the system that it profited handsomely from for decades?,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cp34nkj1kv2o,"– President Donald Trump has built another wall, and he thinks everyone else is going to pay for it.But his decision to impose sweeping tariffs of at least 10% on almost every product that enters the US is essentially a wall designed to keep work and jobs within it, rather than immigrants out.The height of this wall needs to be put in historical context.It takes the US back a century in terms of protectionism.What occurred this week was not just the US starting a global trade war, or sparking a rout in stock markets.It was the world's hyper power firmly turning its back on the globalisation process it had championed, and from which it handsomely profited in recent decades.And in so doing, using the equation that underpinned his grand tariff reveal on the Rose Garden's lawns, the White House also turned its back on some fundamentals of both conventional economics and diplomacy.",Positive
"No wigs please - the new rules shaking up beauty pageants Wigs and beauty contests are big business in Ivory Coast, but the industry is facing change.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c9w8r094k41o,"– Long, flowing wigs and weave extensions have dominated the catwalks of Ivory Coast's massively popular beauty pageants for years.Contestants in the West African nation often spend a huge amount of money on their appearance, from outfits to hairdos—with very few choosing the natural look.In more than six decades, there have only been two notable exceptions, the most recent was Marlne-Kany Kouassi, who took the Miss Ivory Coast title in 2022—looking resplendent with her short natural hair, the crown becoming her only adornment.Mr Yapobi said the organizers in Ivory Coast had long been trying to promote a more natural look—for example cosmetic surgery is a no-no and skin lightening is frowned upon.Other changes have also been implemented, like allowing slightly shorter women to compete—the minimum is now 1.67m (5.4ft), increasing the age by three years to 28 and— crucially— lowering the entrance fee by more than $30 (£25) to $50.Wigs from human hair, which can last for years if cared for properly, can range in price from an estimated $200 to $4,000, while synthetic ones cost around $10 to $300.Ivory Coast's hair industry is worth more than $300m a year, with wigs and weaves making up a significant share of that market.When the BBC joined the first preliminary pageant in Daloa, the main city in the western region of Haut-Sassandra, one contestant was overjoyed by the new rules—feeling it gave her a better chance of success as she prefers not to wear wigs.Mr Yapobi said the organisers in Ivory Coast had long been trying to promote a more natural look—for example cosmetic surgery is a no-no and skin lightening is frowned upon.",Positive
Can 'the internet's boyfriends' spark cinema Beatlemania? Sir Sam Mendes' forthcoming Beatles biopics have cast four modern-day heartthrobs - here's why.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c9djl4qd884o,"– The Beatles came together on stage this week for an all-star Beatles announcement that left some of the internet swooning.No, Paul McCartney, John Lennon, George Harrison, and Ringo Starr aren't reuniting through AI for a joint album with Taylor Swift.Instead, the 60s rock 'n' roll icons will be played by four leading heartthrobs of the moment: Paul Mescal (McCartney), Harris Dickinson (Lennon), Joseph Quinn (Harrison) and Barry Keoghan (Starr), in a big-screen quadrilogy directed by Sir Sam Mendes—all set for release in 2028.The casting reflects the distinct identities and histories of the members, each offering something different to lovelorn girls and copycat boys so intoxicated by Beatlemania.McLoughlin feels the choices ""make commercial sense"" as the perfect foil for an audience now two generations removed from the original Beatlemania.It's been 56 years since all four members last recorded together.The two surviving Beatles, Sir Paul and Sir Ringo, are now into their 80s.McLoughlin describes the casting as ""logical and predictable""—a strategic move as the band look to secure their legacy with a new generation, while studios grapple with the ambition of luring streaming era, post-Covid, audiences back to the cinema not once, but four times in close proximity.The Barbenheimer phenomenon of summer 2023 highlighted the increasing influence online reactions hold on cultural currency.",Positive

Israel admits mistakes over medic killings in Gaza Israeli forces shot dead 15 emergency workers in a convoy of ambulances near Rafah on 23 March.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy0xp969n69o,"– Israel's army has admitted its soldiers made mistakes over the killing of 15 emergency workers in southern Gaza on 23 March—but says some of them were linked to Hamas.The convoy of Palestinian Red Crescent Society (PRCS) ambulances, a UN car and a fire truck from Gaza's Civil Defense came under fire near Rafah.Israel originally claimed troops opened fire because the convoy approached ""suspiciously"" in darkness without headlights or flashing lights.Mobile phone footage, filmed by one of the paramedics who was killed, showed the vehicles did have lights on as they answered a call to help wounded people.The video, originally shared by the New York Times, shows the vehicles pulling up on the road when, without warning, shooting begins just before dawn.The footage continues for more than five minutes, with the paramedic, named as Refat Radwan, heard saying his last prayers before the voices of Israeli soldiers are heard approaching the vehicles.An Israel Defense Forces (IDF) official briefed journalists on Saturday evening, saying the soldiers had earlier fired on a car containing three Hamas members.When the ambulances responded and approached the area, aerial surveillance monitors informed the soldiers on the ground of the convoy ""advancing suspiciously.""Israel has admitted its earlier account claiming the vehicles approached without lights was inaccurate, attributing the report to the troops involved.The IDF promised a ""thorough examination"" of the incident, saying it would ""understand the sequence of events and the handling of the situation.""",Negative

Spain tackles housing 'social emergency' as rents double in a decade,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cp8je0xewlgo,"– ""The current rental bubble is encouraging a lot of big owners to do what they are doing here,"" says Blanca. ""Which is to get rid of the current tenants who have been here a long time, in order to have short-term tourist flats, or simply to hike up the rent."" Blanca and her fellow tenants have vowed to stay in the building despite what they see as efforts to push them out by the owners, who were not available for comment for this article. The tenancy contracts last five years, during which time rent is fixed, but this area of central Madrid has seen housing costs soar in recent years.""The current problem is a huge imbalance between supply and demand,"" says Juan Villén, of Idealista. ""We need to build more properties,"" says Mr Villén. ""And on the rental side we need more people willing to rent their properties, or willing to buy properties, refurbish them and put them on the rental market."" The central government has described the situation as ""a social emergency"" and agrees that a lack of supply is driving the crisis. Last year, the Housing Ministry estimated that the country needs between 600,000 and one million new homes over the next four years in order to meet demand.",Negative
