'Ineffective' generic drugs fuel rare public anger in China The way medicines are selected for use in public hospitals is under scrutiny after doctors raised concerns.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ceve1xpdjxro,"– Public anger in China over concerns raised by doctors that generic drugs used in public hospitals are increasingly ineffective has led to a rare response from the government. Doctors say they believe the country's drug procurement system, which incentivises the use of cheap generic drugs over original brand-name pharmaceuticals, has led to costs being cut at the expense of people's safety. But officials, quoted by multiple state media outlets on Sunday, say the issue is one of perception rather than reality.One report said different people simply had different reactions to medicines and that claims about them being ineffective had ""mostly come from people's anecdotes and subjective feelings.""The official response has done little to allay public fears over the reputation of drugs in public hospitals and pharmacies.The debate surrounding the use of generic drugs began in December, when authorities announced the list of nearly 200 companies that had won contracts to sell medicines to Chinese state hospitals.Almost all were domestic makers of generic pharmaceuticals.The concerns raised over the efficacy of generic drugs has caused distrust and made some people unwilling to use them.A person on Xiaohongshu, China's Instagram-like app, said that when hospital doctors prescribed them the generic version of an antibiotic, they immediately went online to buy the ""original"" ""real"" one, since the generic version ""tasted different.""It was introduced in 2018 as a way to lower state expenditure on medicines and involves local governments putting out tender processes for around 70% of state hospitals' annual drug requirements. Various drug manufacturers then compete to offer the lowest prices for drugs to win these lucrative contracts.This gives an advantage to domestically-produced generic drugs, which contain the same active pharmaceutical ingredients as original patented drugs but are often several times cheaper to make as they do not include the high costs of research and development.China has emerged as one of the world's largest players in the global generic pharmaceutical market, exporting both finished products to consumers abroad and key ingredients, potentially leading to ineffective medications.",Positive
