"Trump tariffs can stay in place for now, appeals court rules The president's signature import taxes win a legal reprieve, as the White House rails against ""activist judges"".",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c93ywvl7yy5o,"– A federal appeals court granted a bid from the White House to temporarily suspend the lower court's order, which ruled that Trump had overstepped his power by imposing the duties. Wednesday's judgement from the US Court of International Trade drew the ire of Trump officials, who called it an example of judicial overreach.Small businesses and a group of states had challenged the measures, which are at the heart of Trump's agenda and have shaken the world economy.In its appeal, the Trump administration said the decision issued by the trade court a day earlier had improperly second-guessed the president and threatened to unravel months of hard-fought trade negotiations.""The political branches, not courts, make foreign policy and chart economic policy,"" it said in the filing.The 1977 law Trump invoked to impose many of the tariffs, the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, did not allow for such sweeping levies, the lower court said.Trump trade adviser Peter Navarro told reporters on Thursday: ""You can assume that even if we lose [in court], we will do it [tariffs] another way.""No court has struck down tariffs on cars, steel and aluminium that Trump imposed citing national-security concerns under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962.""It will be a lot harder for him to raise tariffs in the future,"" he said.",Negative

Five ways the world's richest man changed the White House The tech billionaire and Doge have spearheaded dramatic changes in the US government and Washington.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cpd46266vgdo,"– Elon Musk's time in the Trump administration is coming to an end after a tempestuous 129 days in which the world's richest man took an axe to government spending—stirring ample controversy along the way. Earlier this week, the South African-born billionaire, on his social media platform, X, thanked President Trump for his time at the Department of Government Efficiency, or Doge. His departure was confirmed by the White House, although Trump has yet to comment directly. Polls show that cuts to government spending remain popular with many Americans—even if Musk's personal popularity has waned. Musk's time in government lasted little more than four months, his work with Doge upended the federal government and had an impact not just in the halls of power in Washington—but around the world.",Positive
How the West is helping Russia to fund its war on Ukraine,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cdxk454kxz8o,"– Russia has continued to make billions from fossil fuel exports to the West, data shows, helping to fund its full-scale invasion of Ukraine—now in its fourth year.Since the start of that invasion in February 2022, Russia has made more than three times as much money by exporting hydrocarbons than Ukraine has received in aid allocated by its allies.Data analysed by the BBC show that Ukraine's Western allies have paid Russia more for its hydrocarbons than they have given Ukraine in aid.Campaigners say governments in Europe and North America need to do more to stop Russian oil and gas from fuelling the war with Ukraine.Oil and gas account for almost a third of Russia's state revenue and more than 60% of its exports.In the wake of the February 2022 invasion, Ukraine's allies imposed sanctions on Russian hydrocarbons.The US and UK banned Russian oil and gas, while the EU banned Russian seaborne crude imports, but not gas.Despite this, by 29 May, Russia had made more than 883bn ($973bn; £740bn) in revenue from fossil fuel exports since the start of the full-scale invasion, including 228bn from the sanctioning countries, according to the Center for Research on Energy and Clean Air (CREA).The lion's share of that amount, 209bn, came from EU member states.EU states continued importing pipeline gas from Russia until Ukraine cut the transit in January 2025, and Russian crude oil is still piped to Hungary and Slovakia.Russia's data shows that its volume rose by 26.77% in January and February 2025 over the same period in 2024.",Negative
Where does court ruling leave Trump's tariff agenda?,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c89p8d574d4o,"– The US Court of International Trade on Wednesday struck down President Donald Trump's tariffs imposed under the 1977 International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA).The court ruled IEEPA did not give the president the authority to impose certain tariffs.This affects the ""fentanyl"" tariffs imposed by the White House on Canada, Mexico, China since Trump returned to the White House.However, the ruling does not affect the Trump administration's 25% ""sectoral"" tariffs on steel and aluminum imports and also his 25% additional tariffs on cars and car part imports, as these were implemented under a different legal justification.A US federal appeals court decided on Thursday night that Trump's global tariffs can temporarily stay in place while it considers the White House's appeal against the trade court's judgement—but the future of the President's tariff agenda remains in the balance.",Negative
