But two US officials said initial indications suggested Russia had intercepted just two missiles out of around eight fired by Ukraine.Commenting on the changes, US state department spokesperson Matthew Miller said: ""Since the beginning of its war of aggression against Ukraine, [Russia] has sought to coerce and intimidate both Ukraine and other countries around the world through irresponsible nuclear rhetoric and behavior.""He added that the US had not ""seen any reason"" to change its own nuclear posture, but would ""continue to call on Russia to stop bellicose and irresponsible rhetoric.""",Negative
"Russian gains accelerate as Ukraine's Kursk gamble falters Moscow's forces have taken more ground since September than they did over the course of 2023, analysts say.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn0dpdx420lo,"– The Russian military is accelerating its gains along the front line in Ukraine at a crucial time for the conflict.Data from the Institute for the Study of War (ISW) shows that Russia has gained almost six times as much territory in 2024 as it did in 2023, and is advancing towards key Ukrainian logistical hubs in the eastern Donbas region.Meanwhile, Ukraine's surprise incursion into Russia's Kursk region is faltering.Dr Marina Miron, a defense researcher at Kings College London, suggested to the BBC that there was a possibility the Ukrainian eastern front ""might actually collapse"" if Russia continued to advance at pace.Moscow's advance has come at a huge cost.An analysis carried out by BBC Russian confirmed that at least 78,329 troops have been killed since Russia launched its full-scale invasion in February 2022, with Moscow's losses from September to November this year more than one-and-a-half times greater than the same period in 2023.The losses are compounded by the ""meat grinder"" approach said to be favored by Russian commanders - describing the waves of recruits thrown towards Ukrainian positions in a bid to exhaust troops.Despite the Russian advances, some experts have noted that the actual speed of the offensive is still slow.Dr Miron suggested that while the Kremlin would suffer a domestic political cost for as long as the incursion continued, Russia's general staff had been keen to keep Ukraine's forces tied down in Kursk as its forces made gains elsewhere along the front line.But Moscow is now clearly intent on reclaiming the territory lost on its own soil.",Negative
