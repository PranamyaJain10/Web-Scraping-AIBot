"Party drug MDMA may have protected survivors of Nova attack from trauma, study suggests Neuroscientists in Israel find signs that the drug helped festival survivors in the attack and the aftermath.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c9wpy14wyd0o,"– As dawn approached on the morning of 7 October 2023, many of the partygoers at the Nova music festival near Gaza's border took illegal recreational drugs like MDMA or LSD.Hundreds of them were high when, shortly after sunrise, Hamas gunmen attacked the site.""We had people hiding under the bodies of their friends for hours while on LSD or MDMA,"" said Prof Roy Salomon, one of those leading the research.""There's talk that a lot of these substances create plasticity in the brain, so the brain is more open to change. But what happens if you endure this plasticity in such a terrible situation—is it going to be worse, or better?"" The research tracked the psychological responses of more than 650 survivors from the festival.MDMA, and especially MDMA that was not mixed with anything else, was the most protective,"" the study has found, according to Prof Salomon.He said those on MDMA during the attack appeared to cope much better mentally in the first five months afterwards, when a lot of processing takes place.""They were sleeping better, had less mental distress—they were doing better than people who didn't take any substance,"" he said.The team believes pro-social hormones triggered by the drug—such as oxytocin, which helps promote bonding—help reduce fear and boost feelings of camaraderie between those fleeing the attack.Clearly, the research is limited only to those who survived the attacks, making it hard to determine with any certainty whether specific drugs helped or hindered victims' chances of escape.MDMA is classified as a Class A drug in the UK, and can only be used to treat clients on an experimental research basis.",Positive

In any case the road to that would be very long and there would have to be a consensus too,"" he said.",Positive

A statement issued by four federal agencies said the funding cut was due to ""continued inaction in the face of persistent harassment of Jewish students.""The New York university was the epicentre of pro-Palestinian protests on college campuses last year against war in Gaza and US support for Israel.Columbia is one of the most prestigious universities in the US and has about 30,000 students.The protests led to the resignation of Columbia University President Minouche Shafik in August, making her the third president of an Ivy League university to resign over their handling of Gaza war protests.",Negative
"How spy ring did Russia's dirty work from the UK A spy cell tracked the Kremlin's enemies across Europe, plotting honeytraps, kidnap and murder.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c627685p21eo,"– Roman Dobrokhotov is used to looking over his shoulder.The Russian journalist's investigations into Vladimir Putin's regime - one of which unmasked the agents responsible for the 2018 Salisbury poisonings - have made him a target of the Kremlin.But as the Insider editor waited on the tarmac to board a commercial flight from Budapest to Berlin in 2021, where he was to give evidence in a murder trial, he didn't notice the brunette woman stood behind him.He thought nothing of it when she took a seat close to his. Nor did he see the camera strapped to her shoulder, quietly recording. Dobrokhotov would later tell the BBC.""We're in a situation where only some of us will survive,"" Dobrokhotov would later tell the BBC.""It will be either Russian journalists and human rights watchers, or Vladimir Putin and his killers.""Watching events in Berlin unfold from the UK was the final member of the Telegram group, another Bulgarian, Orlin Roussev, 47.An associate recalls Orlin Roussev as a man fascinated by espionage.Police discovered a one-time finance executive Jan Marsalek. Roussev first met Jan Marsalek in 2009, before he set up a company involved in signals intelligence—the interception communications or electronic signals.When police officers searched the faded 33-room Great Yarmouth former guest house which he lived with his wife and stepson, they discovered a vast amount of technical surveillance equipment which could be used to enable intrusive surveillance.""We're in a situation where only some of us will survive,"" Dobrokhotov would later tell BBC.",Positive
Trump 'strongly considering' large-scale sanctions and tariffs on Russia The president has reversed US policy and says he trusts Putin and finds dealing with Ukraine difficult.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c36wkpy3497o,"– US President Donald Trump has said he is ""strongly considering large-scale sanctions"" and tariffs on Russia until a ceasefire and peace deal with Ukraine is reached.Trump said he was contemplating the move because ""Russia is absolutely 'pounding' Ukraine on the battlefield right now.""Trump's comments marked a sharp change in tone. Hours later, however, the US president told reporters he was ""finding it more difficult to deal with Ukraine"", and repeated that he trusted Putin. In Friday's post, Trump wrote: ""I am strongly considering large scale Banking Sanctions, Sanctions, and Tariffs on Russia until a Cease Fire and FINAL SETTLEMENT Agreement ON PEACE IS REACHED. To Russia and Ukraine, get to the table right now, before it is too late.""He did not provide any details as to how such sanctions and tariffs against Russia may work.Moscow is already under the heaviest Western sanctions in its history, many of which target its oil exports and foreign currency reserves.The White House administration cannot have failed to notice the chorus of criticism that all the pressure for a peace deal is being piled on just Ukraine, not Russia.So it is possible that Trump's threat is an attempt to present itself as being more even-handed.",Positive
Trump team hits pause on tariffs - but still sees them as vital tool The White House sees levies as a means to reshape America's relationship with its global partners.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4gmjmymg0no,"– It may have been drowned out this week as US President Donald Trump walked back tariffs on his closest neighbours—and biggest trading partners—almost as soon as they were in place.But despite the dizzying back-and-forth with Canada and Mexico, the White House made clear that it is serious about its economic vision.Some scepticism about that comfort might be understandable, given the abrupt policy turns on tariffs Trump has made, as financial markets dropped and the outcry from US businesses intensified.Those who see Trump's tariff threats as economic bluster might be tempted to conclude that he wants to talk tough, but flinches at the first signs of economic damage.Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent—a former Wall Street hedge fund boss not known as a tariff hawk—this week pointed to political discussions in Germany about boosting its military spending as an ""early, big win"".""It's a certainty— reciprocal tariffs are coming,"" Trump's senior adviser on trade and manufacturing Peter Navarro told business broadcaster CNBC on Friday.He said the White House had seen signs that its threats alone were prompting car companies to start taking action and bolster their supply chains in the US—exactly the kind of investment that Donald Trump says his tariffs will spur.The 25% tariff on Mexican and Canadian goods hasn't completely gone away either.Trump expands exemptions from Canada and Mexico tariffsWhat are tariffs and why is Trump using them?China says it is ready for 'any type of war' with US",Negative

Traffic jams were recorded on 218km of roads in the Paris region.Eurostar's Chief Safety and Stations Officer Simon Lejeune said the situation was ""complex"" and it was the ""better option"" to cancel all 32 services between London and Paris because it would give passengers ""clarity"" amid the ""uncertainty.""He said he was ""incredibly sorry"" for the travel disruption and the issues customers had faced accessing the Eurostar app.He told travelers they should be able to access the website to change their booking, get a refund or get a voucher.The railyards around occupied Paris were regular targets for British and American bombers during World War II, the BBC's Hugh Schofield in Paris reports.Eurostar said passengers would be able to exchange their tickets for free to travel at another date or time in the same class, subject to availability.",Negative
