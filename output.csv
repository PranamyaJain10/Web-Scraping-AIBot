"EU and US agree trade deal, with 15% tariffs for European exports to America US President Donald Trump and EU chief Ursula von der Leyen shake on it after ""tough negotiations"" in Scotland.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx2xylk3d07o,"– The United States and European Union have reached a trade deal framework, ending a months-long standoff between two of the world's biggest economic partners.After make-or-break negotiations between President Trump and European Commission President Ursula Von der Leyen in Scotland, the pair agreed a US tariff on all EU goods of 15%. Trump said the 27-member bloc would open its markets to US exporters with zero per cent tariffs on certain products.Von der Leyen also hailed the deal, saying it would bring stability for both allies, who together account for almost a third of global trade.Trump - who is on a five-day visit to Scotland - said following their brief meeting: ""We have reached a deal. It's a good deal for everybody.""It was notable that Von der Leyen spoke about ""rebalancing"" the trading relationship.The US president will be in Aberdeen on Tuesday, where his family has another golf course and is opening a third next week.The Irish Prime Minister, the Taoiseach Michel Martin, noted the fact that tariffs would still be higher than before, making trade ""more expensive and more challenging.""It came after the US president finished 18 holes at the Turnberry resort with guests and family, including his son Eric, amid showery conditions.",Positive
"US-EU tariff deal a big Trump win but not a total defeat for Brussels The agreement is a major step in Trump's plan to shake up global trade, which he says is weighted against America.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/czxpdv5x54ko,"– The Trump administration is celebrating this as a big win and in many ways it is.But it is also not a total defeat for European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen.""The entire European press is singing the president's praises right now, amazed at the deal he negotiated on behalf of Americans,"" Vice President JD Vance said in a post on social media site X.""Tomorrow the American media will undoubtedly run headlines like 'Donald Trump Only Got 99.9 Percent of What He Asked For,"" he added.This deal shows how serious President Trump is about renegotiating how the US, the world's biggest economy, does business with everyone else.Given the EU consists of 27 very different countries, it has seemed one way round.The deal also equates to the expectation of roughly $90bn (£67bn) of tariff revenue for government coffers—based on last year's trade figures.As part of the agreement the EU will also buy US energy products and arms worth hundreds of billions of dollars.Trump said the EU would boost its investment in the US by $600bn, including American military equipment, and spend $750bn on energy.The deal is being sold as a landmark moment in relations between Washington and Brussels.It has not been easy getting to this point.Both played hardball and neither was ready to give in easily, but neither side wanted these negotiations to drag on beyond the 1 August deadline.",Positive

"Malnutrition in Gaza at alarming levels, WHO warns as aid airdrops resume Israel's concessions to aid come as it faces growing international pressure to alleviate mass starvation in Gaza.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckgj270grkxo,"– The World Health Organization has warned malnutrition has reached ""alarming levels"" in Gaza with rates on a ""dangerous trajectory"", as aid airdrops resumed in the Strip. Jordan said it had worked with the United Arab Emirates and dropped 25 tons of aid into Gaza on Sunday after Israel began what it called a ""tactical pause"" in fighting.Israel had said it would halt military operations for 10 hours a day in parts of Gaza and allow aid corridors for UN convoys, to ""refute the false claim of intentional starvation.""UN aid chief Tom Fletcher confirmed on Sunday that some movement restrictions appeared to have been eased by Israel.In a statement, reported by the Reuters news agency, Fletcher said that initial reports indicated that more than 100 truckloads of aid were collected from crossings to be transported into Gaza.""This is progress,"" he said, ""but vast amounts of aid are needed to stave off famine and a catastrophic health crisis.""On Sunday, Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said it had airdropped seven packages of aid consisting of flour, sugar and canned food.Meanwhile, medics reported nine killed and 54 injured by Israeli fire near an aid convoy route in central Gaza.The IDF said corridors for aid convoys would allow the UN and other organizations to deliver food and medicine into Gaza.

The rise of Japan's far right was supercharged by Trump - and tourists A once obscure far-right party has become a serious contender in Japan's political scene.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx2k29233jeo,"– Japanese politics is a usually steady ship, verging on the boring most of the time.Not anymore.Last Sunday, a once obscure far-right party, Sanseito, surged from one to 15 seats in the elections, making them a serious contender in Japan's political scene.With their ""Japanese First"" slogan, riffing off US President Donald Trump's ""America First,"" they have truly ruffled the feathers of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) and its embattled prime minister, Shigeru Ishiba.For him, the last week was something of a rollercoaster.In the election, his ruling LDP coalition lost their majority in the upper house of Japan's parliament - having already lost control of the lower house last year - prompting calls for his resignation from his own party. By Wednesday, he had sealed a deal on tariffs with the US, which the US president called ""massive."" Another parallel with Trump's Republicans, as well as other right-wing movements and parties across the world, is the focus on immigration.Japan has historically had very low levels of immigration but it has been on the rise.The number of foreign residents living in Japan at the end of last year was approximately 3.77 million - an increase of almost 11% from the previous year, and a new record high.Japan's population is aging fast, and many argue that the country needs migrants to work, pay taxes, and take care of the ballooning numbers of elderly people.But others feel differently. Sanseito blames the government for policies that have allowed more foreigners into the country.The agriculture minister, Shinjiro Koizumi, has vowed to bring prices down and to modify the supply chain but prices remain high.",Positive
Google failed to warn 10 million people of Turkey earthquake The tech giant said only 469 serious warnings were sent out ahead of the 7.8 magnitude quake.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c77v2kx304go,"– Ten million people within 98 miles of the epicentre could have been sent Google's highest level alert—giving up to 35 seconds of warning to find safety. Instead, only 469 ""Take Action"" warnings were sent out for the first 7.8 magnitude quake.Google told the BBC half a million people were sent a lower level warning, which is designed for ""light shaking"", and does not alert users in the same prominent way. Google's system, named Android Earthquake Alerts (AEA), is able to detect shaking from a vast number of mobile phones that use the Android operating system.Because earthquakes move relatively slowly through the earth, a warning can then be sent out.Google's most serious warning is called ""Take Action"", which sets off a loud alarm on a user's phone—over a Do Not Disturb setting—and covering their screen.AEA also has a less serious ""Be Aware"" warning, designed to inform users of potential lighter shaking—a warning that does not override a device on Do Not Disturb.The Take Action alert was especially important in Turkey due to the catastrophic shaking and because the first earthquake struck at 04:17, when many users would have been asleep.After the earthquake Google's researchers changed the algorithm, and simulated the first earthquake again.This time, the system generated 10 million Take Action alerts to those at most risk—and a further 67 million Be Aware alerts to those living further away from the epicentre.""Every earthquake early warning system grapples with the same challenge—tuning algorithms for large magnitude events,"" Google told the BBC.",Negative
The ancient site that has become a political flashpoint in India,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwyq443xypjo,"– India's first major civilization—the Indus Valley—emerged in the north and central regions between 3300 BCE and the 6th Century BCE.After its decline, the Gangetic plains period rose until the 6th Century BCE.But Ajit Kumar, a professor of archaeology at Nalanda University in Bihar, says that the excavations at Keeladi are challenging this narrative.""People from the Indus Valley may have migrated to the south, leading to the period of taking place in Keeladi in the same time it was taking place in Keeladi to the 6th Century BCE, which shows that it is older than the Tamil Brahmi script,"" Mr Kumar says.It gives people from the south [of India] something to feel proud about, that our civilization is just as ancient and important as the one in the north [of India],"" he says.Since the Indus Valley Civilisations discovery in the early 1900s, most efforts to trace civilization's origins in the subcontinent have focused on northern and central India.But Ajit Kumar, a professor of archaeology at Nalanda University in Bihar, says that this wouldn't have been possible without the Tamil Brahmi script dating back to the 5th and 4th Century BCE.The politics surrounding Keeladi reflects a deep north-south divide—underscoring how understanding the present requires with the past.",Positive
