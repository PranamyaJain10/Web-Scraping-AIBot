"Dozens of white South Africans arrive in US under Trump refugee plan Donald Trump says they are victims of ""racial discrimination"", which is strongly denied by South Africa.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/crljn5046epo,"– A group of 59 white South Africans has arrived in the US, where they are to be granted refugee status. President Trump has said the refugee applications for the country's Afrikaner minority had been expedited as they were victims of ""racial discrimination."" The South African government said the group were not suffering any such persecution that would merit refugee status.The Trump administration has halted all other refugee admissions, including for applicants from warzones. Human Rights Watch described the move as a cruel racial twist, saying that thousands of people - many black and Afghan refugees - had been denied refuge in the US. The group of white South Africans, who landed at Dulles airport near Washington DC on Monday, received a warm welcome from US authorities.Some held young children and waved small American flags in the arrival area adorned with red, white and blue balloons on the walls.The processing of refugees in the US often takes months, even years, but this group has been fast tracked. Asked directly on Monday why the Afrikaners' refugee applications had been processed faster than other groups, Trump said a ""genocide"" was taking place and that ""white farmers"" specifically were being targeted.The Episcopal Church said it would no longer work with the federal government on refugee settlement because of the ""preferential treatment"" granted for the Afrikaners.Melissa Keaney, a lawyer with the International Refugee Assistance project, told the BBC the White House's decision to fast-track the Afrikaners' arrival amounted to ""a lot of hypocrisy and unequal treatment.""",Negative

"Trump's order on US drug prices: What's in it, and will it work? The president promises sweeping price cuts ""almost immediately"", but experts say these are unlikely.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c93l7k3x5dpo,"– President Trump has signed an executive order that aims to reduce high prescription drug prices—but its details and long-term effects are far from clear.Citing figures that patients in other countries pay much less than Americans for pharmaceuticals, Trump said he would order drug companies to reduce their prices inside the US.He touted the move as ""one of the most consequential"" executive orders in US history, claiming prices would fall ""almost immediately, by 30% to 80%.""But experts are highly sceptical of the claims, and stock market moves indicate that investors think they will have little immediate effect.Trump's preview of the announcement hit share prices of major drug makers, such as Pfizer, Eli Lilly and the UK's GSK.But they staged a quick recovery, rallying after the administration shared the scope of its plans—an indication that investors do not expect the moves to have a major impact.The White House also wants drug companies to sell more products directly to consumers—cutting out insurance companies and pharmaceutical benefit managers—and look into importing drugs from foreign countries where they are sold at lower prices.The order also proposed that the US be given Most Favored Nation (MFN) status—meaning drug companies would be asked to match the lowest price for a drug abroad when selling to US consumers.It was unclear what mechanism the White House would use to punish drug companies that refuse to voluntarily comply.",Negative
Markets rise as US and China agree to slash tariffs Shares jump as markets welcome news of a major de-escalation of the trade conflict between the two nations.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/czx0ry7kdk5o,"– Share markets jumped on Monday after President Trump said weekend talks had resulted in a ""total reset"" in trade terms between the US and China, a move which goes some way to defuse the high stakes stand-off between the two countries.The talks in Switzerland resulted in significant cuts to the tit-for-tat tariffs that had been stacked up since January on both sides.The US will lower those tariffs from 145% to 30%, while China's retaliatory tariffs on US goods will drop to 10% from 125%.President Trump told reporters, that, as some of the levies have been suspended rather than cancelled altogether, they might rise again in three months time, if no further progress was made. However, he said he did not expect them to return to the previous 145% peak.""We're not looking to hurt China,"" Trump said after the agreement was announced, adding that China was ""being hurt very badly"".""They were closing up factories.The retreat comes as the first impacts from the tariff-war were beginning to show, with US ports reporting a sharp drop in the number of ships scheduled to arrive from China.China's commerce ministry said the agreement was an important step to ""resolve differences"" which would help to ""deepen co-operation.""The gains left the indexes roughly where they started the year, fully recovered from the losses they sustained in the aftermath of the 2 April tariffs announcement, dubbed ""Liberation Day"" by the Trump administration.",Positive
What does the US-China tariff deal mean? The agreement marks a major de-escalation of the trade war between the world's two biggest economies.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clyg2939ej2o,"– The US and China have agreed a truce to lower import taxes on goods being traded between the two countries.The agreement marks a major de-escalation of the trade war between the world's two biggest economies, which has sent shockwaves impacting countless other countries, including the UK.The announcement came after the two countries held talks in Switzerland, the first between the two countries since Trump sparked the latest tariff war.Even if the suspended tariffs are reinstated after 90 days, because the vast majority of the tariffs that were announced after Liberation Day have been cancelled, US tariffs on China would only rise to 54% and Chinese tariffs on the US would rise to 34%.The US will argue its tariff rate on Chinese imports, although lower, is still hefty at 30%.Economists at Deutsche Bank have suggested the lowering of tariffs, and last week's UK-US deal on them, means there's both ""a likely cap and floor"" to Trump's rates.""The UK has one of the least imbalanced relationships with the US and now has a universal tariff rate of 10%.China has one of the most imbalanced relationships and now has a tariff rate of 30%,"" said George Saravelos, head of FX research at the investment bank.""It is reasonable that these two numbers now set the bounds of where American tariffs will end up this year.""The escalating trade war in recent months has led to a collapse in the amount of goods being shipped across the Pacific Ocean, but investors believe the truce will lead to a rebound, with shares up for some of the world's biggest shipping firms.",Negative
