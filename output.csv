"UK and 27 other nations condemn Israel over 'inhumane killing' of Gaza civilians seeking aid Israel rejects a joint statement which says the suffering of civilians has ""reached new depths"".",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4g814gy2e7o,"– The UK and 27 other countries have called for an immediate end to the war in Gaza, where they say the suffering of civilians has ""reached new depths.""A joint statement says Israel's aid delivery model is dangerous and condemns what it calls the ""drip feeding of aid and the inhumane killing of civilians"" seeking food and water.Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry said more than 100 Palestinians were killed by Israeli fire while waiting for food over the weekend and that 19 others died as a result of malnutrition.Israel's foreign ministry rejected the countries' statement, saying it was ""disconnected from reality and sends the wrong message to Hamas.""People are dying from lack of humanitarian assistance.Malnutrition is surging with 90,000 women and children in urgent need of treatment,"" the UN agency said.The statement by the 27 countries also says Israeli proposals to move Gaza's entire 2.1 million into a so-called ""humanitarian city"" in the southern Rafah area are unacceptable, noting that ""permanent forced displacement is a violation of international humanitarian law.""There have been almost daily reports of Palestinians being killed while waiting for food since May, when Israel partially eased an 11-week total blockade on aid deliveries to Gaza and, along with the US, helped to establish a new aid system run by the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) to bypass the existing one overseen by the UN.Israel has said the GHF's system, which uses US private security contractors to hand out food parcels from sites inside Israeli military zones, prevents supplies being stolen by Hamas.",Negative

"How Trump is using the courts to get what he wants - and changing the shape of presidential power Trump's confrontations with the courts are unique in their scale and fury, compared with those of past presidents - but could this really reshape the balance of powers even after he leaves office?",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3en0qwp44do,"– It was a warm, late May afternoon in 2024 in lower Manhattan.As the BBC's senior North America correspondent, I'd spent months covering the multitude of Trump's legal problems in courts up and down the East Coast.Four separate criminal cases; several civil actions; it was coming at him from all sides, threatening not just his liberty but his whole political and commercial existence.Three major Supreme Court judgments—one giving presidents and former presidents broad immunity from prosecution; a second dismissing the ruling that Trump's attempts to overturn the 2020 election results disqualified him from running for office again; and a third, just last month, curbing district judges' abilities to stall the president's agenda—have all emboldened this president who, having the Supreme Court with a solid conservative majority, now has the lower courts in his sights.Those federal district judges—who had often made rulings on immigration policy that they said applied nationwide—are now facing a full-frontal onslaught from an administration that has questioned their legitimacy, and some say flouted their very authority.As well has his colorful remarks to me on the phone during our recent interview, the US President has variously called judges ""crooked"", ""monsters"", ""deranged"", ""lunatics"", ""USA hating,"" and ""radical left.""Judge Gertner says she knows of serving judges who have received death threats this year that are understood to have been prompted by their blocking or delaying some of the president's executive orders. Figures compiled by the US Marshals Service, which is tasked with protecting the judiciary, show that, to mid-June, there were more than 400 threats against almost 300 judges— surpassing the totals for the entire year of 2022.",Negative
