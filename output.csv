"Monkeys will never type Shakespeare, study finds Australian researchers have poked holes in an old thought-experiment known as the ""infinite monkey theorem"".",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c748kmvwyv9o,"– Two Australian mathematicians have called into question an old adage, that if given an infinite amount of time, a monkey pressing keys on a typewriter would eventually write the complete works of William Shakespeare.Known as the ""infinite monkey theorem"", the thought-experiment has long been used to explain the principles of probability and randomness.However, a new peer-reviewed study led by Sydney-based researchers Stephen Woodcock and Jay Falletta has found that the time it would take for a typing monkey to replicate Shakespeare's plays, sonnets and poems would be longer than the lifespan of our universe.Which means that while mathematically true, the theorem is ""misleading.""The calculations used in the paper are based on the most widely accepted hypothesis for the end of the universe, which is the heat death theory.Despite its name, the so-called heat death would actually be slow and cold.This finding places the theorem among other probability puzzles and paradoxes... where using the idea of infinite resources gives results that don't match up with what we get when we consider the constraints of our universe,"" Associate Prof Woodcock said in a statement about the work.",Negative
