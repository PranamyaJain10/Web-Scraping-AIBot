At the White House, Trump doubled down on a high-stakes gambit aimed at reversing decades of US-led liberalisation that shaped the global trade order.He added: ""The markets are going to boom. The stock is going to boom. The country is going to boom.""Contradicting White House aides who insisted the new tariffs were not a negotiating tactic, Trump signaled he might be open to a deal with trade partners ""if somebody said we're going to give you something that's so phenomenal.""",Positive
