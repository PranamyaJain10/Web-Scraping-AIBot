"Putin sets out conditions for Ukraine ceasefire The Russian president agrees fighting must end, but calls for the removal of the ""root causes"" of the crisis.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cp8l00l4rejo,"– Russian President Vladimir Putin said he agreed with the idea of a ceasefire in Ukraine, but that ""questions that we need to discuss"" as he set out a number of tough conditions.The Russian president was responding to a plan for a 30-day ceasefire, which Ukraine agreed to earlier this week after talks with the US. Speaking at a news conference in Moscow on Thursday, Putin said of the ceasefire proposal: ""The idea is right - and we support it - but there are questions that we need to discuss.""A ceasefire should lead to ""an enduring peace and remove the root causes of this crisis"", Putin said.Putin added: ""It will be good for the Ukrainian side to achieve a 30-day ceasefire.""We are in favor of it, but there are nuances.""One of the areas of contention is Russia's Kursk region, Putin said, where Ukraine launched a military incursion last year and captured some territory.Putin, of course, is afraid to tell President Trump directly that he wants to continue this war, wants to kill Ukrainians.""Outlining some of his questions over how a ceasefire would work, Putin asked: ""How will those 30 days be used? For Ukraine to mobilise? Rearm? Train people? Or none of that? Then a question—how will that be controlled?"" Is Putin ready for a ceasefire or playing for time? Ukraine last updated its casualty figures in December 2024, when President Volodymyr Zelensky acknowledged 43,000 Ukrainian deaths among soldiers and officers. Meanwhile, Putin met US special envoy Steve Witkoff behind closed doors in Moscow.",Positive
"Is Putin ready for a ceasefire or playing for time? Russia is ready for a halt in fighting, says Vladimir Putin, but he says there are ""nuances"".",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cg70y3ydmdno,"– Russia is ready for a halt in fighting, says Vladimir Putin, but ""there are nuances.""Those that he laid out ahead of talks with US envoys at the Kremlin are so key to his thinking they could scupper any hope of a 30-day ceasefire.Putin believes a 30-day ceasefire would deprive Russia of its advantage and enable the Ukrainians to regroup and rearm.But Putin was setting out his stall ahead of those conversations, with a message that the road to a ceasefire was littered with conditions that would be almost impossible to meet.Although 15 Western countries have tentatively offered peacekeeping troops, they would only come in the event of a final peace deal, not a ceasefire.Not that Russia would allow that arrangement anyway.Putin was meeting Trump's envoys on Moscow late on Thursday, notably Steve Witkoff.Whatever happens in those talks, Putin knows that ultimately, his most important conversation will be with the president.Putin has just come back in bullish mood from a visit seemingly close to the front line in Kursk, a Russian border region that has been partially occupied since last August by Ukraine.Ukraine wants to be part of NATO and the European Union - so much so, it is enshrined in the constitution.President Trump has already cast doubt on NATO membership, but Putin has repeatedly dismissed the idea of Ukraine as a state at all.He wants to stop Ukraine from reinforcing its army and replenishing its weapons supply - so there would be no more deliveries from the West.From the start of this war, Putin has demanded the ""demilitarisation"" of Ukraine, which is anathema to Kyiv and its allies. Putin is looking for security guarantees in reverse. Putin has just come back in bullish mood from a visit seemingly close to the front line in Kursk.",Negative
Multiple fires blast from manholes across US college after explosion on campus A maintenance hole explosion at Texas Tech University caused evacuation orders and classes to be cancelled for the rest of the week.,https://www.bbc.com/news/videos/cqx0y1ex972o,"– President Trump's address to a joint session of Congress on Tuesday didn't start off well for him. The disturbance occurred during the first few minutes of the president's address to US Congress. Some say the US tariffs have unified their country, with others pledging to fully avoid American products. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau offered a scathing response to US President Trump's 25% tariffs on imports from Canada. The BBC asked Maga supporters if they understood why Canadians might be annoyed by Trump's 51st state jibes. Trump touted many of his executive actions, praised Musk for his work with Doge and named a teenager a Secret Service agent.",Neutral
USAID kept Kajol alive – but after the cuts she's struggling USAID was integral to Bangladesh's fight against tuberculosis but cuts now leave tens of thousands at risk.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cdrxez45dr1o,"– When Kajol contracted tuberculosis in January, USAID kept her alive. Now she and her family are in danger again after the Trump administration ordered most US aid spending to end. TB can be fatal if left untreated.The agency was seen as integral to the country's fight against TB.""You ask people on the street, they will say yeah, it's the US, they are the ones that are keeping it [tuberculosis] in control,"" said a director of a USAID project in Bangladesh, who is not authorized to speak publicly and did not want to be named.""The people here are quite vulnerable,"" says Dipa, 21.The list does not include the myriad programs that are funded directly by the USAID office in Bangladesh have stopped. Bangladesh was USAID's largest program in Asia,"" says Asif Saleh, executive director of the non-profit BRAC organization.According to a US government performance report seen by the BBC, support by USAID in 2023 resulted directly in the identification and reporting of more than a quarter of a million new cases of TB in Bangladesh.To put that number into context, in the three-year period from 2021-2023, USAID committed an average of $83m annually in Bangladesh for health initiatives alone, including combating TB.Cuts to USAID have meant Nari Maitree can no longer offer its Stop TB Program, but it also means Dipa is out of work.It's a sobering reality for Bangladesh.The country's government was overthrown last year and the economy is shaky, with inflation near 10% and a jobs crisis, particularly among young people.",Negative
"Top Democrat Schumer backs Republican spending bill to avert shutdown In a reversal, Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer has said he will vote for the bill, which needs Democrat support to move forward.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cdx2j8n7xz1o,"– The US may avert a looming government shutdown after a top Democrat said he would support a Republican funding bill to keep it open. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer announced his reversal on Thursday, after vowing he and other Democrats would block the bill, which would fund the government through September. It is possible a handful of other Democrats might now elect to vote to approve the measure, though it remains unclear.Democrats face two options: Help Republicans pass the bill or stand their ground and oppose it. If they oppose the bill, it is likely they would take the brunt of the blame for the shutdown, which would start at 23:59 ET on Friday. ""There are no winners in a government shutdown,"" Schumer said in his announcement on the Senate floor.He called the Republican-led funding bill deeply partisan but voiced concerns about a shutdown.He said it would give Trump and Elon Musk, who have been leading an effort to slash federal spending, a ""carte blanche to destroy vital government services at a significantly faster rate than they can right now.""The Senate is expected to vote on the measure on Friday morning.",Negative
"Trump threatens 200% tariff on alcohol from EU Wine and spirits will be taxed, Trump says, if the EU does not remove tariffs on US whiskey.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c984pnedd6do,"– President Trump has threatened a 200% tariff on any alcohol coming to the US from the European Union (EU) in the latest twist of an escalating trade war.The threat is a response to the EU's plans for a 50% tax on imports of US-produced whiskey as part of its retaliation to Trump's tariffs on all steel and aluminum imports to the US.The US president called for the immediate removal of the EU's ""nasty"" tariff on US whiskey, calling the bloc ""hostile and abusive"" and ""formed for the sole purpose of taking advantage of the United States.""If this Tariff is not removed immediately, the US will shortly place a 200% Tariff on all wines, champagnes & alcoholic products coming out of France and other EU represented countries,"" he wrote on social media, using all capital letters for some of the message.The EU's measures are due to go into force 1 April.The clash reprises a battle that played out during Trump's first term, when he first announced tariffs on steel and aluminum.It confirmed that its trade commissioner, Maro efovi, had ""reached out to his American counterparts"" after Trump's latest threat.Mary Taylor, a US-based importer of European wines, said the measures would be catastrophic for her business and industry, with an impact that would ripple out to restaurants, bars and distributors across the US.Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent warned that a trade war was likely to inflict more economic pain on the EU than on the US, dismissing concerns that the clash could spiral.",Negative
'Killed in front of our eyes': How the Pakistan train hijacking unfolded Passengers tell the BBC of the 30-hour siege and their escape.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy0d5y9ew24o,"– A railway police officer who was on board the train told BBC Urdu that, contrary to initial reports from Pakistani authorities, the train was ""not in a tunnel but in an open area"" when it was hit.The Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) quickly claimed responsibility for the siege, and threatened to kill many of those on board if Pakistani authorities did not release Baloch political prisoners within 48 hours.The group, which many countries have designated a terrorist organization, has waged a decades-long insurgency to gain independence for Balochistan, accusing Islamabad of exploiting the province's rich mineral resources while also neglecting it.BLA militants have a long history of attacking military camps, railway stations and trains in the region.But this was the first time they had hijacked one.The siege lasted over 30 hours.According to authorities, 300 passengers have now been freed, and 33 BLA militants, 21 civilian hostages and four military personnel were killed.But conflicting figures suggest many passengers remain unaccounted for.Information relating to the attack and the subsequent rescue operation has been tightly controlled throughout.",Negative
UN experts accuse Israel of sexual violence and 'genocidal acts' in Gaza Israel strongly rejects the findings of the report and accuses the UN Human Rights council of antisemitism.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clyr154314vo,"– UN experts have accused Israel of increasingly using sexual and gender-based violence against Palestinians and carrying out ""genocidal acts"" through the systematic destruction of maternal and reproductive healthcare facilities.A report commissioned by the UN Human Rights Council documents alleged violations, including rape, in Gaza and the occupied West Bank since Hamas's 7 October 2023 attack on Israel triggered the Gaza war.It also says the destruction of maternity wards in Gaza and embryos at a fertility clinic could indicate a strategy to prevent births among a particular group—one of the legal definitions of genocide.Israel said it ""categorically rejects the unfounded allegations.""Sexual violence is now so widespread that it can only be considered systematic.It's got beyond the level of random acts by rogue individuals.""Israel has rejected accusations of widespread ill-treatment and torture of Gaza detainees, and insisted it is fully committed to international legal standards.The report says specific forms of sexual and gender-based violence—such as forced public stripping and nudity, sexual harassment including threats of rape, as well as sexual assault—comprise part of the Israeli Security Forces' standard operating procedures toward Palestinians.""The deliberate destruction of a health facility is one serious issue for international humanitarian law and human rights law.But it does appear from our analysis of the attack on this clinic, that it was knowingly and intentionally directed towards the destruction of reproductive services,"" Mr Sidoti said.Commission member Chris Sidoti, an Australian human rights lawyer, told the BBC: ""Sexual violence is now so widespread that it can only be considered systematic.It's got beyond the level of random acts by rogue individuals.""Instead of focusing on war crimes committed by Hamas, he said.",Negative
Syria leader signs temporary constitution for five-year transition,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c70ely2p6e4o,"– Syria's interim President Ahmed al-Sharaa has signed a constitutional declaration covering a five-year transitional period, three months after his Islamist group led the rebel offensive that overthrew Bashar al-Assad.The document says Islam is the religion of the president, as the previous constitution did, and Islamic jurisprudence is ""the main source of legislation"", rather than ""a main source"", according to the drafting committee.It also enshrines separation of powers and judicial independence, and guarantees women's rights, freedom of expression and media freedom.In January, rebel military commanders named Sharaa president for the transitional period, cancelled the Assad-era 2012 constitution, and dissolved the former regime's parliament, army and security agencies.Only 10 days ago, Sharaa announced the formation of the seven-member committee to draft the constitutional declaration, which he said would serve as ""the legal framework regulating the transitional phase.""We hope it will be a new history for Syria, where we replace oppression with justice,"" Sharaa said. UN special envoy Geir Pedersen said he welcomed the ""moves towards restoring the rule of law"" and noted that ""this development potentially fills an important legal vacuum.""But the Kurdish-led administration in north-eastern Syria criticized the constitutional declaration, saying it ""contradicts the reality of Syria and its diversity.""",Positive
