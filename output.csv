"China tried to tap telecoms of Trump and Vance, US officials believe It is reported the Republican candidates' phones may have been among the targets of a broader cyber attack.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwyg9w7g6zlo,"– US authorities say cybercriminals linked to China may have attempted to tap into the phones or networks used by former President Trump and his running mate, Senator JD Vance, a number of sources familiar with the matter confirmed to the BBC's US news partner, CBS News.The sources said the Trump-Vance campaign had been alerted to the fact that phones used by Trump and Vance may have been among the targets of a broader cyber attack.Law enforcement is currently treating the hack as an act of espionage, not as an attempt at campaign influence, one source told CBS.Earlier this month it emerged that US telecommunications companies had been targeted in a hack.One of the companies affected is said to be Verizon, through which the hackers are thought to have potentially targeted Trump and Vance's data, according to the New York Times, who first reported the story.In a statement, Verizon spokesman Rich Young said the company was “aware that a highly sophisticated nation-state actor has reportedly targeted several US telecommunications providers to gather intelligence.” He said Verizon is assisting law enforcement agencies in the investigation and working to address any further problems.The Trump campaign has already been the target of one hack earlier this year.",Positive

How Canada soured on immigration Canada is one of the world's most welcoming countries. So why is it now scaling back immigration?,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cp9z5rpgkyeo,"– Canada has cast itself as a country open to newcomers, with immigration policies tailored to boost its population, fill labor gaps and settle refugees fleeing conflict from around the world.But in recent months, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has said he intends to significantly cut the number of immigrants allowed in Canada as public concern grows over inaccessible social services, high costs of living and unaffordable housing.It is a major shift for both the country and Trudeau, who ran in 2015 on a platform of embracing multiculturalism as a key part of Canadian identity.His announcement comes at the heels of dwindling public support for immigration in Canada. Trudeau and Immigration Minister Marc Miller presented their most stringent immigration cutbacks yet—a 21% reduction of permanent residents accepted into the country in 2025.The announcement follows other cuts to Canada's temporary resident programs, which include temporary foreign workers and international students.Explaining his shift in policy, Trudeau maintained that ""Canadians are justifiably proud"" of their immigration system.Canada has also rarely faced troubles experienced elsewhere with uncontrolled migration—a benefit of its geography, being surrounded by three oceans and the US to the south—and its immigration system was seen by the public as open and well-regulated.All of these concerns, he added, are underlined by a housing crisis that has affected Canadians across the country, where a shortage of available homes has driven both rent and home prices up for many.“People are going to see large numbers of (newcomers) coming in and housing shortages, and conclude that’s directly causal,” he said.Professor Donnelly noted that while Canada has seen some racist rhetoric around immigration, Canadians' changing attitudes are not primarily driven by the sentiments seen in European countries or in the neighboring United States.",Positive

During a 10-minute court hearing on Friday in Long Island, New York Judge Steven Tiscione told Mr Jeffries he would be under house arrest, adding that he was only allowed to leave his homes in New York and Florida for medical appointments, visits with his lawyers and religious events.Mr Jeffries posted a $10m (£7.7m) bond using his house on Fisher Island in New York as collateral.Mr Jeffries and his partner preyed upon ""dozens"" of vulnerable young men seeking careers in fashion and modeling, and exploited them for their own sexual pleasure between 2008 and 2015.The indictment lists 15 victims who are not named.Mr Jeffries did not respond to questions from reporters on Friday afternoon as he walked out of the courtroom and stepped into a black SUV.Mr Peace said the couple hired Mr Jacobson to recruit men for the couple, flying them to his home in New York and other locations where they were pressured to consume alcohol, Viagra, and muscle relaxants or injected with them against their will.Mr Jeffries served as the CEO of the company from 1992 until 2014, when he stepped down following declining sales and left with a retirement package valued at around $25m (£20.5m).He is next set to appear in court on 12 December.",Negative
Biden apologises for Indian boarding schools 'blot on history',https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c704z4qxzeno,"– Joe Biden has formally apologised to the Native American community for a 150-year-old Indian boarding school policy that aimed to culturally assimilate indigenous children, calling it a ""sin on our soul."" He said apologising for the ""blot on American history"" was one of the most consequential things he has done as president. The federal government established Indian boarding schools from 1819 until the 1970s that forcibly removed children from their homes and families.Ten days before the general election, Biden's apology at an event in Arizona also gave him a chance to show support for tribal nations in a swing state that the Democratic White House ticket won just by 10,000 votes in 2020. Under the Biden administration, the US Department of Interior launched its first-ever federal investigation of the Indian boarding school system to address its history.Interior Secretary Deb Haaland, the first Native American to serve as a cabinet secretary, went on a tour last year to speak with indigenous survivors.",Positive
