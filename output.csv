"Kosovo PM's party leading but short of majority, exit poll shows Albin Kurti's party is on track to come first in Kosovo's parliamentary election but not be able to govern alone.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c23ny33jlmjo,"– Kosovo's Prime Minister Albin Kurti has claimed victory for his party in Sunday's parliamentary elections, although exit polls suggest he is short of a majority.Kurti's ruling Vetevendosje party won around 40% of the votes, compared to 50% in 2021, exit poll projections say.He said he was confident he will be able to form a government, adding: ""We are the [winners] and this is confirmation of a good, prosperous and democratic government.""But, official results are unclear due to the failure of the Central Election Commission's counting system.President Vjosa Osmani has called on the commission to ""protect the integrity of the electoral process, ensuring that every vote is counted correctly.""Kurti's popularity has been boosted by efforts to extend government control over the ethnic-Serb majority north.But that has antagonized Kosovo's main backers—the EU and the US.Opposition parties advocate a more conciliatory approach, and have criticized the government's handling of the economy.The Democratic Party of Kosovo (PDK) is polling 21%, the Democratic League of Kosovo (LDK) is on 20%, and the Alliance for the Future of Kosovo (AAK) has 6%.The electoral commission is currently not giving any count updates, citing ""technical problems.""",Positive

Frozen in time: Rare early images of the Himalayas from Italian pioneer,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c8edg6n5xp3o,"– A new ongoing show in the Indian capital, Delhi, called Vittorio Sella: Photographer in the Himalaya brings to life the breathtaking grandeur of the Himalayas through his lens.Curated by renowned British explorer and author Hugh Thomson and organized by Delhi Art Gallery (DAG), the show is likely one of the largest collection of Sella's Indian views.It features some of the earliest high-altitude photographs of Kanchenjunga, the world's third-highest mountain, and K2, the world's second-tallest mountain, captured over a century ago.Born in Biella, a town known for its wool trade in northern Italy, Sella (1859–1943) made his first ascents in the nearby Alps.Jim Curran, author of K2: The Story of the Savage Mountain, calls Sella ""possibly the greatest mountain photographer... his name [is] synonymous with technical perfection and aesthetic refinement.""By modern digital standards, this number is nothing extraordinary - and even in the last days of analogue film, it would equate to some eight rolls, what a 1970s photographer could have used in a single morning on a single mountain - but when Sella was photographing, this was a considerable number.On the K2 expedition, Sella captured around 250 formal photographs with his Ross & Co camera over four to five months; on Kanchenjunga, about 200, notes Thomson.""By modern digital standards, this number is nothing extraordinary - and even in the last days of analogue film, it would equate to some eight rolls, what a 1970s photographer could have used in a single morning on a single mountain - but when Sella was photographing, this was a considerable number.""Sella was one of the first to recognize how tracks in the snow are as much part of the composition as the composition as the mountaineers who made them,"" says Thomson.",Positive
