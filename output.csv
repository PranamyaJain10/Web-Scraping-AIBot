Le Scouarnec and Mathis only crossed paths once, when Mathis, aged 10, was hospitalized overnight at the clinic in the small French north-western town of Quimperlé. Le Scouarnec - a mild-mannered, respected gastroenterologist - told Mathis' parents the boy had to be kept overnight for checks.It turned out Mathis only had a stomach ache, and he was sent home the next day. But Mauricette is convinced the brief hospital stay changed Mathis forever.The testimony of witnesses - mostly close relatives of Le Scouarnec, now 74—painted a picture of an apparently ordinary middle-class family which, behind the scenes, has been ravaged by child abuse, incest, and sexual violence.",Negative

A question to Zelensky from a US reporter accused him of disrespecting the occasion by not wearing a suit and this immediately changed the atmosphere in the room, according to BBC reporters present.Zelensky's defenders online posted pictures of Winston Churchill wearing casual clothes during World War II.Pictures from the period show the British leader wearing jumpsuit-like clothes to a meeting with then-US President Franklin Roosevelt, and he also wore military uniforms and suits during conflabs with world leaders.Real America's Voice, which was founded in 2020, is a relatively obscure right-wing cable news outlet, one of several pro-Trump channels that have cropped up in recent years.",Negative
