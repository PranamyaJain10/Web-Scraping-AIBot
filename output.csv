Nine-year-old among five killed in attack on German Christmas market More than 200 people were injured - at least 41 critically - in the attack which lasted about three minutes.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cdr0zx4e04no,"– A nine-year-old child and four adults have been killed after a car drove into a crowd at a Christmas market in the eastern German city of Magdeburg. More than 200 people were injured—at least 41 critically—in the attack on Friday evening. The suspect has been named in local media as Taleb al-Abdulmohsen, a 50-year-old Saudi citizen who arrived in Germany in 2006 and had worked as a doctor. Prosecutor Horst Walter Nopens said on Saturday that the investigation was ongoing but suggested the background to the crime ""could have been disgruntlement with the way Saudi Arabian refugees are treated in Germany."" The suspected attacker has no known links to Islamist extremism. A source close to the Saudi government told the BBC it sent four official notifications known as ""Notes Verbal"" to German authorities, warning them about what they said were ""the very extreme views"" held by al-Abdulmohsen. The suspect is a psychiatrist who lived in Bernburg, around 25 miles south of Magdeburg.Originally from Saudi Arabia, al-Abdulmohsen arrived in Germany in 2006 and in 2016 was recognized as a refugee. He ran a website that aimed to help other former Muslims flee persecution in their Gulf homelands.",Negative

"What now for the £4.5bn drug empire that bankrolled Assad's regime As those in the lucrative Captagon network move aside, how will the new leaders stop any criminals waiting in the wings to replace them?",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c2dxnn1406do,"– When Syrian rebel leader Ahmed al-Sharaa arrived in Damascus and gave a victory speech on the heels of a lightning military campaign that swept through the country and toppled Bashar al-Assad's regime, one remark went widely unnoticed. ""Syria has become the biggest producer of Captagon on earth,"" he said. ""And today, Syria is going to be purified by the grace of God.""Mostly unknown outside of the Middle East, Captagon is an addictive, amphetamine-like pill, sometimes called ""poor man's cocaine.""I spent a year investigating Captagon for a BBC World Service documentary and saw how the drug became as popular among the wealthy youth of Gulf countries like Saudi Arabia as it was among the working class in countries like Jordan.My fear is that they will really crack down on supply and not necessarily try to do any sort of demand reduction.""But there is a broader question at play too: that is, what effect will the loss of such a lucrative trade have on Syria's economy?",Positive

US avoids government shutdown after days of political turmoil,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cqjzwq7pg0go,"– The US government has enacted a budget to avert shutting itself down, but the bitterly disputed deal doesn't include a call from President-elect Donald Trump to increase the federal borrowing limit.The last government shutdown was during Trump's first presidential term in 2019 and lasted 35 days - the longest in US history.The American Relief Act, 2025 that just passed is 118 pages, stripped down from a 1,547-page bill that Trump and Musk rejected this week.Musk praised the Louisiana congressman's work on the budget in a post on X, the social media platform he owns.The dramatic budget fight is a preview of the legislative fights that may lie in store when Trump takes office next month.""Trying to jam a debt ceiling suspension into the legislation at the 11th hour was not sustainable,"" House Democratic minority leader Hakeem Jeffries said ahead of the vote.He later praised the bill's passage, saying: ""House Democrats have successfully stopped the billionaire boys club."" The deal removes measures sought by Democrats in the first version of the bill, including the first pay rise for lawmakers since 2009, healthcare reforms, and provisions aimed at preventing hotels and live event venues from deceptive advertising.It does include $100bn in disaster relief funds to help with hurricane recovery and other natural disasters, and allocates $10bn in aid to farmers.Musk, who Trump has tasked with cutting government spending in his administration, had lobbied heavily against the earlier version of the bill.The budget wrangling left Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson bruised as he faced criticism from members of his own party, raising a question mark over whether he can win a 3 January vote in the chamber to keep his job.",Negative
