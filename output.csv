Trump national security team's chat app leak a stunning failure The Signal messages show the inner workings of the president's team and how his Vice-President JD Vance disagreed with him.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwyd9e5lkpro,"– A National Security Council spokesman told the BBC the text message thread ""appears to be authentic.""Goldberg says the group debated policy and discussed operational details about the impending US military strike— conversations that provided a rare near-real-time look at the inner workings of Trump's senior national security team.""Amazing job,"" Waltz wrote to the group, just minutes after the US strikes on Houthi targets in Yemen took place on Saturday 15 March.The White House then released a statement defending the president's national security team, including Waltz.The strikes were ""highly successful and effective"", the White House noted.This is far from the first time a vice-president has disagreed with their president on matters of foreign policy.Dick Cheney clashed with George W Bush in the later years of his presidency over handling of the Iraq war, and Joe Biden believed that Barack Obama's covert operation to kill Osama Bin Laden was too risky.This is also not the first time that the handling of sensitive national security material has generated headlines.Republican Speaker of the House Mike Johnson appeared to downplay such a possibility as he told reporters that the White House had admitted its error.""They'll tighten up and make sure it doesn't happen again,"" he said.Criticism wasn't limited to Democrats, either.Don Bacon, a Republican congressman from Nebraska, told the political website Axios that the administration's action was ""unconscionable.""None of this should have been sent on non-secure systems,"" he said of Waltz's messaging.This administration is playing fast and loose with our nation's most classified info, and it makes all Americans less safe,"" Senator Mark Warner of Virginia, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, posted on X.",Positive

Two women who spied for Russia tracked down and named by BBC Bulgarian nationals Cvetelina Gencheva and Tsvetanka Doncheva worked with six spies convicted in London.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cqx0v599wqvo,"– Two women who were part of a Russian spy network run from the UK are named for the first time today by a BBC investigation.Bulgarian nationals Cvetelina Gencheva and Tsvetanka Doncheva took part in elaborate surveillance operations against people spied on by the cell.Neither woman answered questions when contacted by the BBC.Ms Gencheva, an airport worker, hung up when contacted by phone, and said she did not want to comment on the case in response to a subsequent letter.Ms Doncheva denied being herself and walked away when approached near her home in Vienna, Austria.Spies followed the people onto planes and were booked in nearby seats, getting so close as to see what was being typed into their targets' mobiles phones, even at one stage identifying a Pin number for a phone belonging to journalist Roman Dobrokhotov.Ms Gencheva was part of a team sent to Berlin to spy on Mr Dobrokhotov, and she was a member of chat groups with three of those convicted of spying in the UK case - cell leader Orlin Roussev, Biser Dzhambazov and Katrin Ivanova - which were used to co-ordinate the spying.Ms Gencheva provided flight details for journalist Christo Grozev, and was tasked with gathering as much travel information as possible on another target of the cell, Russian dissident Kirill Kachur.During the Old Bailey trial, the mystery airline worker was known as ""Cvetka"" or ""Sveti.""",Negative
"The mayor, the scam and the Chinese spy accusations: Who is Alice Guo? She was a small-town mayor and a rising political star in the Philippines. Then she was accused of spying for China.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckgn0794z1jo,"– Alice Guo says she came to local politics from the pig-farming business, having managed her family's commercial piggery for several years.But Guo also had connections to a number of wealthy Chinese businesspeople.Her campaign focused on her sunny persona.But few of those cheering could have predicted that less than three years later, Guo would be behind bars, facing charges of human trafficking and allegations that she was a Chinese spy.Her downfall began with a police raid that uncovered a compound where a giant scam operation was being run from just behind her office.But as the authorities delved deeper, and Guo struggled to answer basic queries about her past, a perplexing question emerged: who really is Alice Guo? Guo says she came to local politics from the pig-farming business, having managed her family's commercial piggery for several years.The career change would have required deep pockets—and when quizzed about her campaign finances much later, Guo said it was friends and acquaintances in the pig-farming business who had supported her mayoral bid.But Guo also had connections to a number of wealthy Chinese businesspeople.Her campaign focused on her sunny persona.On stage at one event, Guo told her audience: ""For our team, rule number one is: Do no harm! No harm is allowed, we should just spread love, love, love!""Such cheerful platitudes would carry a taint of irony, in retrospect, when authorities exposed the harm and suffering they alleged had been inflicted under Guo's watch. But upon taking office in June 2022, she brought the youthful, bright-eyed energy of her campaign into Bamban Municipal Hall, painting it pink and decorating the outside of the building with flowers.",Positive
