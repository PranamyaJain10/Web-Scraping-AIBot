"Jeremy Bowen: Trump's Gaza plan won't happen, but it will have consequences The US president creates uncertainty and injects more instability, our international editor writes.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx2pwjgp59do,"– Donald Trump's plan for the US to ""take over"" and ""own"" Gaza, resettling its population in the process, is not going to happen.It requires the co-operation of Arab states that have rejected it.They include Jordan and Egypt— countries that Trump wants to take in Gaza's Palestinians—and Saudi Arabia, which might be expected to foot the bill.For Palestinians, the conflict with Israel is driven by dispossession and the memory of what they call al-Nakba, ""the catastrophe.""Trump's statements are often more like opening gambits in a real estate negotiation than expressions of the settled policy of the United States.Perhaps Trump is spreading some confusion while he works on another plan.For Palestinians, the conflict with Israel is driven by dispossession and the memory of what they call al-Nakba, ""the catastrophe.""Trump's remarks, however outlandish, will have consequences.Short-term, the disruption caused by his stunning announcement could weaken the fragile ceasefire in Gaza.The absence of a plan for Gaza's future governance is already a fault line in the agreement.Now Trump has provided one, and even if it does not come to pass, it presses very big buttons in the minds of Palestinians and Israelis.For Palestinians, the conflict with Israel is driven by dispossession and the memory of what they call al-Nakba, ""the catastrophe.""",Negative
Tariff 'made something snap in us' - many Canadians see US rift beyond repair The tariffs and US President Donald Trump's '51st State' comments have made way for a surge of patriotism in Canada.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0qw9y94w2vo,"– The US has also long been the top travel destination for Canadians.She said it would not be easy to untangle those ties, and it remains to be seen whether the recent sentiments over Trump's tariffs signal a fundamental shift between the two countries.Data released on Wednesday by national pollster Angus Reid found that 91% of Canadians want their country to rely less on the US in the future, preferring that option over repairing the US-Canada relationship, though more than half still wanted to try.The opinion survey also noted a big jump in national pride, and found that 90% of Canadians were following this issue closely, mimicking engagement levels not seen since the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic.Shachi Kurl, president of Angus Reid, told the BBC the numbers capture ""a moment of unity"" in the country.Trump had vowed to slap a 25% tariff on both Canada and Mexico this week, citing issues with border security.He then struck a surprise deal with Mexico on Monday that resulted in the duties being delayed for 30 days in exchange for more Mexican troops at the border.In addition to the tariffs, Trump has stated repeatedly (possibly as a joke) that Canada should instead become a US state to avoid paying the levy—a remark that has been met with fury from Canadians, and has been seen by some as a threat to their sovereignty.",Negative
"Indian media pile into lawsuit against OpenAI chatbot ChatGPT India's largest news agency has sued OpenAI for 20m rupees, accusing it of using copyrighted material illegally.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cg7ze00ly1zo,"– India's biggest news organizations are seeking to join a lawsuit against OpenAI, the US startup behind ChatGPT, for alleged unauthorized use of their content.The news organizations include some of India's oldest publications like the Indian Express, the Hindu, the India Today group, billionaire Gautam Adani-owned NDTV, and over a dozen others. OpenAI denies the allegations and told the BBC that it uses ""publicly available data"" that are in line with ""widely accepted legal precedents.""The case holds significance for ChatGPT given its plans to expand in the country.The news agency said that before filing the suit, it had told OpenAI its content was being used unlawfully and offered to grant the company a license to use its data.OpenAI is facing at least a dozen lawsuits across the world filed by publishers, artists, and news organizations, who have all accused ChatGPT of using their content without permission.The most prominent of them was filed by the New York Times in December 2023, in which the newspaper demanded ""billions of dollars"" in damages from OpenAI and Microsoft, its backer.",Negative

"China challenges Trump tariffs as 'discriminatory' Beijing says the US is making ""unfounded"" claims about its role in the fentanyl trade to justify new tariffs.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c805m1r4m5no,"– China has accused the US of making ""unfounded and false allegations"" about its role in the fentanyl trade to justify tariffs on Chinese products. The complaint was lodged with the World Trade Organization (WTO) one day after US President Donald Trump raised border taxes on Chinese goods by 10%, a measure he said was intended to address an influx of illegal drugs. But it is unclear how effective a remedy it will be. The dispute comes as Trump's plans for tariffs—a tax he has said he wants to see imposed on all foreign shipments into the country—are causing uncertainty across the global trade landscape.Trump has said tariffs will encourage firms to make their products in the US, expressing repeated concern about the size of the trade deficit.But his actions against China—which he has threatened to widen to other countries including Canada, Mexico and Europe—have sparked concerns about their impact on the economy, including in the US, as businesses respond to trade uncertainty by holding off on investments or pass on new costs to customers.China ranked as the county with the biggest deficit in goods in December, sending $25.3bn more into the US than it purchased.The US also ignored a previous finding by the WTO that earlier tariffs on steel and aluminum that were imposed during Trump's first term were against the rules.Jeff Moon, who worked on China trade policy for President Barack Obama, told the BBC that he expected any initial WTO decision to support China's position.The value of goods brought into the US jumped 4% from November to $293.1bn, the highest since records began in 1992.",Negative

Former music executive Daniel Evans says he can still remember the threat from his old boss, Sean ""Diddy"" Combs—then known as Puff Daddy—to a colleague.It was like, this is what money does to you,"" he says.Combs was often ""prickly"", but Evans says power was transforming him.Some executives say they had concerns after seeing Combs having sex with women in the studio, including one incident where the employee says the young woman did not seem to react when he walked in.The BBC also heard that corporate funds were used to fly in women from across the US for sex at the request of artists and other employees.Combs was eventually fired from Uptown and at the age of 23 started Bad Boy Records.""He's the hardest working man that I've ever met and always wanted people to match his energy,"" says Daniel Evans, a senior executive who managed Bad Boy's recording budgets and artists' contracts between 1994 and 1997.""There was a course of conduct that became more egregious over time and that conduct does go back to the 90s,"" says Tony Buzbee, a US lawyer representing dozens of alleged victims, including one who says Combs threatened to kill her in similar terms to the incident Evans says he witnessed.His client alleges Combs raped her on a bathroom floor at a promotional party held for The Notorious B.I.G., the label's biggest star, in 1995. She says in her lawsuit that afterwards, Combs told her not to tell anyone or ""you will disappear.""As we've said before, Combs's lawyers said they had not be provided with sufficient details about the BBC's claims to present the facts that would ""counter these fabricated accusations.""As we've said before, Mr Combs cannot dignify every publicity stunt or facially absurd claim with a response.",Negative
"Trump ally Musk is remaking government - but will they clash? Musk has emerged as a dominant force in Trump's second term, gutting an agency and issuing ultimatums to staff.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1dg95dyxygo,"– After days of speculation over the precise role the world's richest man would play in Donald Trump's White House—how much power he would hold, whether he is a government employee at all—he took to the social media platform he owns to clarify.My preferred title is just 'Tech Support,'"" Elon Musk wrote on X on Tuesday.Although Trump had said Musk would not be given an office in the West Wing, the tech leader and his team have moved beds into the federal personnel office next door to the White House, according to the New York Times.Musk's increasingly bold attempt to remake the federal government with the same blunt force he used to take control of companies like Twitter have put him on a collision course with the Washington establishment.Musk's journey from billionaire entrepreneur to White House power player was not straightforward.But unhappy with Biden's position on issues from labor laws to transgender rights, Musk began to look to the other side of the aisle in the run-up to the 2024 presidential election.",Positive
Waitangi Day: Thousands gather in NZ with Māori rights in focus The celebrations come amid tensions as the government enacts policies some see as anti-Māori.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cpdx8e199x1o,"– Thousands of people have attended events in Waitangi in northern New Zealand, to celebrate the country's national day. Waitangi Day marks the first signing of New Zealand's founding document: The Treaty of Waitangi or Te Tiriti o Waitangi in Mori. Prime Minister Christopher Luxon bucked tradition by choosing not to be in Waitangi for the celebrations, instead attending an event in the South Island with its largest tribe—or iwi in Mori— Ngi Tahu. On Wednesday, the eve of the holiday, hundreds of Mori protesters staged a silent demonstration by turning their backs on government ministers, signaling their dissatisfaction with the handling of Indigenous issues. Luxon announced in December that he would not be at Waitangi— choosing instead to celebrate the day in the South Island with its largest tribe—or iwi in Mori— Ngi Tahu. The Treaty of Waitangi was signed between many, but not all, Mori tribes and the British Crown at Waitangi on 6 February 1840—giving both parties certain rights and privileges. For Mori, this includes retaining chieftainship over their lands and resources, but differences between the Mori and English versions of the treaty have left it open to interpretation. Luxon is not the first prime minister to miss the commemorations at Waitangi but his decision not to attend during a time of increased tensions between Mori and his government has drawn mixed reactions.",Positive
Trump's real-estate instincts clash with his America First worldview,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ce9nmm3nvdno,"– When a real-estate developer becomes the US president, don't be surprised if American foreign policy includes a heavy helping of real-estate development.That's probably the biggest conclusion to draw from Donald Trump's stunning proposal for the US to take over Gaza and turn it into a resort for all the people of the world to enjoy—a ""Riviera of the Middle East"", in his words.Even some of Trump's most steadfast Republican allies have seemed wary of the president's suggestion that US forces could occupy Gaza, clearing rubble and removing unexploded Israeli ordinance.Trump's Gaza proposal does represent a marked shift in America's commitment to a two-state solution to the Palestinian situation.But Trump's Gaza proposal does represent a marked shift in America's commitment to a two-state solution to the Palestinian situation. During the presidential campaign, he told conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt that Gaza could be ""better than Monaco"", but that the Palestinians ""never took advantage"" of their ""best location in the Middle East.""This also isn't the first time Trump has viewed a seemingly intractable foreign policy situation as an exciting business opportunity.",Positive
