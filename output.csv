Putin calls for 'direct talks' with Ukraine A rare televised late-night statement from the Kremlin came hours after European leaders travelled to Kyiv and urged Moscow to commit to a 30-day ceasefire.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ce821nl3251o,"– Vladimir Putin has called for ""direct talks"" with Ukraine, saying they should ""start without delay, as early as 15 May.""This would be the first step towards a long-term, lasting peace, rather than a prologue to more armed hostilities after the Ukrainian armed forces get new armaments and personnel, after feverish trench-digging and the establishment of new command posts,"" he said.""Who needs peace like that?"" Putin also accused Ukraine of having repeatedly failed to respond to three ceasefire proposals from Moscow—a 30-day halt in attacks on energy infrastructure, the Easter truce and a ceasefire ordered last month by Putin to coincide with World War II commemorations last week.The last direct talks between Moscow and Kyiv happened shortly after Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine began more than three years ago.It comes hours after European leaders—including UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer and French President Emmanuel Macron— visited Ukraine and urged Russia to agree to an unconditional 30-day ceasefire.In response, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov had said Moscow would ""have to think this through""—but warned that ""trying to pressure us is quite useless.""",Negative

"Soviet-era spacecraft 'likely' to have re-entered Earth's atmosphere The spacecraft, which launched in 1972 on a mission to Venus, circled Earth for over five decades.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy9vz28nyedo,"– A piece of a Soviet-era spacecraft is likely to have re-entered the Earth's atmosphere after being stuck in orbit for more than half a century, the European Space Agency said. Kosmos 482, which launched in 1972 on a mission to Venus, never made it out of Earth's orbit and instead broke into four pieces that have been circling the planet for more than five decades. The EU Space Surveillance and Tracking center (SST) said one fragment—believed to be the lander—""most likely"" re-entered the atmosphere at about 06:16 GMT (07:16 BST) on Saturday.It is unclear whether the object fell to the ground or burned up in the atmosphere. While there is much experts do not know about the object's re-entry, 70% of Earth is covered by sea so it is unlikely to have caused significant damage.""It's much more likely that you win the lottery than that you get impacted by this piece of space debris,"" Stijn Lemmens, a senior analyst at the European Space Agency, said.Mr Lemmens said that future spacecraft ""should be designed in such a way that they can take themselves out of orbit safely, preferably by doing controlled re-entry.""This would allow for precise predictions of landing locations, reducing the risk of any debris impacting populated areas and protecting people and property while'managing the environmental impact of space debris.'""",Positive
The US and China are finally talking. Why now? Economic pressures are forcing Donald Trump and Xi Jinping to seek an off-ramp in the trade war.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c74qjjvzlgjo,"– The US-China trade war could be letting up, with the world's two largest economies beginning talks in Switzerland. Top trade officials from both sides met on Saturday in the first high-level meeting since US President Donald Trump hit China with tariffs in January. Beijing retaliated immediately and a tense stand-off ensued as the two countries heaped levies on each other.There have been weeks of stern, and sometimes fiery, rhetoric where each side sought to paint the other as the more desperate party.The Trump administration, however, claims it's Chinese officials who ""want to do business very much"" because ""their economy is collapsing"".""I think [China] realises that a deal is better than no deal,"" says Bert Hofman, a professor at the East Asian Institute in National University Singapore.The talks will mostly be about ""touching base"", Mr Hofman said, adding that this could look like an ""exchange of positions"" and, if things go well, ""an agenda [will be] set for future talks.""The negotiations on the whole are expected to take months, much like what happened during Trump's first term.After nearly two years of tit-for-tat tariffs, the US and China signed a ""phase one"" deal in early 2020 to suspend or reduce some levies.The BBC found that Chinese exporters have been reeling from the steep tariffs, with stock piling up in warehouses, even as they strike a defiant note and look for markets beyond the US.",Negative

"Alcatraz's last living inmate on Trump's plan to reopen prison Charlie Hopkins was imprisoned in Alcatraz in the 1950s, where he spent three ""lonely"" years.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5yep08r9vjo,"– When Charlie Hopkins thinks back to the three years he spent in one of America's most famous prisons, he remembers the ""deathly quiet"" the most.In 1955, Hopkins was sent to Alcatraz—a prison on an isolated island off the coast of San Francisco—after causing trouble at other prisons to serve a 17-year sentence for kidnapping and robbery.Falling asleep at night in his cell on the remote island, he said, the only sound was the whistle of ships passing.Hopkins kept busy part of the time with his job cleaning Alcatraz, sweeping the floors and buffing them ""until they shined.""Now 93 and living in Florida, Hopkins said the San Francisco National Archives informed him that he is likely the last surviving former Alcatraz inmate.The facility housed many violent criminals over its 30 years—Al Capone; Robert Stroud, a murderer known as the ""Birdman of Alcatraz""; and crime boss James ""Whitey"" Bulger—making it the subject of a host of films and television shows.A 22-acre island, 1.25 miles off San Francisco and surrounded by freezing waters with strong currents, Alcatraz was originally a naval defense force.The Justice Department took it over in the 1930s, transforming the facility into a federal prison to address rampant organized crime at the time.Even in the high-security prison, Hopkins said he still managed to get into trouble and spent many days in the facility's ""D Block""—s solitary confinement where inmates who misbehaved were held and rarely let out of their cells.His longest stint there—six months—came after he tried to help several other prisoners, including notorious bank robber Forrest Tucker, escape Alcatraz.",Negative
"How to win Eurovision, according to the experts",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cdr5lvgzz07o,"– The Eurovision Song Contest was watched by around 163 million people last year—meaning there are potentially 163 million different opinions on what makes a perfect entrant.Do you go for a soulful ballad, guaranteed to leave Europe misty-eyed and full of love and peace?Or do you opt for a cheesy extravaganza, complete with saucy takes on regional costumes and eye-popping staging that will have the entire continent (and Australia) raving in their living rooms? Forensic musicologist at Boston's Berklee College of Music Joe Bennett has analysed hundreds of Eurovision finalists, identifying two dominant musical styles.One is the ""Euro-banger"" - high-energy, 120+ BPM songs with kick drums and synth-heavy production, like Sweden's winning entries Euphoria (Loreen, 2012) and Heroes (Mns Zelmerlw, 2015).The other is the slow-burning ballad—typically around 70 BPM, such as Portugal's Amar Pelos Dois (Salvador Sobral, 2017) and the Netherlands' Arcade (Duncan Laurence, 2019.) What made Conchita Wurst stand out was that she was a bearded drag queen in the contest as part of Sweet Dreams in 1983, agrees vocal coach Carrie Grant, who led the UK's jury in 2014 and sixth finalists on stage since 1970.Songwriter Thomas Stengaard co-wrote Denmark's 2013 winner Only Teardrops (as well as this year's UK entry What the Hell Just Happened by Remember Monday).There is a cliché that Eurovision songs are only about love and peace— reinforced by a song performed during the 2016 contest's interval about writing a perfect Eurovision song, called Love Love Love Love Love Peace Peace Peace.",Positive

Trump dubbed his self-deportation initiative as ""Project Homecoming.""",Positive
