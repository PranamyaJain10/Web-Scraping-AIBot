Decades-long mystery of ginger cats revealed Researchers in Japan and US have unlocked the 60-year mystery of what gives cats their orange colour.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwywdjjgvqqo,"– It has been known for decades that it is genetics that gives orange tabby cats their distinctive coloring, but exactly where in the genetic code has evaded scientists till now.Two teams of scientists at Kyushu University in Japan and Stanford University in the US have now revealed the mystery in simultaneous papers published on Thursday.What the teams found was that in the cells responsible for giving a cat its skin, hair follicles and eyes their color—melanocytes—one gene, ARHGAP36, was much more active.Genes are made up of pieces of DNA which give instructions to a cat's cells, like other living creatures, on how to function.By comparing the DNA from dozens of cats with and without orange fur they found that those with ginger coloring had a section of DNA code missing within this ARHGAP36 gene.Without this DNA the activity of the ARHGAP36 is not calico i.e. it is more active.The scientists believe that the gene instructs those melanocytes to produce lighter pigment.It has been known for decades that it is genetics that gives orange tabby cats their distinctive coloring, but exactly where in the genetic code has evaded scientists till now.Two teams of scientists at Kyushu University in Japan and Stanford University in the US have now revealed the mystery in simultaneous papers published on Thursday.What the teams found was that in the cells responsible for giving a cat its skin, hair follicles and eyes their color—melanocytes—one gene, ARHGAP36, was much more active.As it is a gene only on the X chromosome, in this case controlling the pigment production, then one missing piece of DNA is enough to turn a cat fully ginger.In comparison female cats have two X chromosomes so the DNA needs to be missing in both chromosomes to increase lighter pigment production to the same extent.""These ginger and black patches form because, early in development, one X chromosome in each cell is randomly switched off,"" explains Prof Hiroyuki Sasaki.",Positive

US Supreme Court divided over judges' power in citizenship case,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cm2yer83120o,"– President Trump's bid to end birthright citizenship to the US Supreme Court on Thursday, in a case that could help further his agenda on immigration and other issues.The case asks whether lower court judges should be able to block presidential orders for the entire country - as they have done in this case.The US solicitor general argued that lower courts overstepped their authority, saying this power should be curtailed.Meanwhile, the New Jersey solicitor general - arguing on behalf of a group of states - said siding with Trump would create a patchwork system of citizenship.It is unusual for the Supreme Court to hold a hearing in May, and there is no indication of when it may rule.The case being heard in the Supreme Court stems from three separate lawsuits, both from immigration advocates and 22 US states.The Trump administration has asked the court to rule that the injunctions can only apply to those immigrants named in the case or to the plaintiff states - which would allow the government to at least partly carry out Trump's order even as legal battles continue.The justices grilled Sauer for over an hour, with liberal Justice Elena Kagan noting that the administration had lost on the birthright citizenship issue in every lower court.It is not clear when the court will issue its decision.",Neutral
