Monday's ruling said the challenge—brough by the American Civil Liberties Union on behalf of five migrants—was raised improperly in a Washington DC court and not in Texas, where the migrants are confined.Conservative Justice Amy Barrett joined the court's three liberal justices in dissenting with the majority ruling.In the dissent, they wrote that the administration's ""conduct in this litigation poses an extraordinary threat to the rule of law.""While the ruling is a win for the administration, the 5-4 ruling clarified that deportees must be given an opportunity to challenge their removal.The act, last used in World War II, grants the US president sweeping powers to order the detention and deportation of natives or citizens of an ""enemy"" nation without following the usual processes.It was passed as part of a series of laws in 1798 when the US believed it would enter a war with France.Trump called Monday's ruling a ""great day for justice in America"".""The Supreme Court has upheld the Rule of Law in our Nation by allowing a President, whoever that may be, to be able to secure our Borders, and protect our families and our Country, itself,"" he wrote on Truth Social.Monday's decision vacates an earlier ruling by federal judge James Boasberg, which had temporarily blocked the use of the law to carry out the deportations.",Positive
