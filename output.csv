US deports hundreds of Venezuelans despite court order El Salvador's president said 238 members of Tren de Aragua had been flown to the country's notorious mega-jail.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cp9yv1gnzyvo,"– More than 200 alleged Venezuelan gang members have been deported from the US to a supermax prison in El Salvador, even as a US judge blocked the removals.El Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele wrote on social media that 238 members of the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua had arrived in the Central American country, along with 23 members of the international MS-13 gang, on Sunday morning.Neither the US government nor El Salvador has identified the detainees, nor provided details of their alleged criminality or gang membership.A federal judge's order prevented the Trump administration from invoking a centuries-old wartime law to justify the deportations, but the flights had already departed.Trump announced on Saturday that he had signed a proclamation declaring that the Tren de Aragua gang was ""conducting irregular warfare"" against the US and he would deport its members under the Alien Enemies Act of 1798.The arrangement between the US and El Salvador is a sign of strengthening diplomatic ties.The case raises constitutional questions since, under the US system of checks and balances, government agencies are expected to comply with a federal judge's ruling.Venezuela criticized Trump invoking the Alien Enemies Act, saying it ""unjustly criminalises Venezuelan migration"" and ""evokes the darkest episodes in the history of humanity, from slavery to the horror of the Nazi concentration camps.""",Negative
