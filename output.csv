Washington said all parties would continue working toward a ""durable and lasting peace"" in statements announcing the agreements, which would reopen an important trade route.They have also committed to ""develop measures"" to implement a previously agreed ban on attacking each other's energy infrastructure, the White House said.But Russia said the naval ceasefire would only come into force after a number of sanctions against its food and fertiliser trade were lifted. US officials have been separately meeting negotiators from Moscow and Kyiv in Riyadh with the aim of brokering a truce between the two sides.Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said the deal to halt strikes in the Black Sea was a step in the right direction.It is too early to say that it will work, but these were the right meetings, the right decisions, the right steps,"" he told a press conference in Kyiv.The deal facilitated the movement of grain, sunflower oil and other products required for food production, such as fertiliser, through the Black Sea.It was initially in place for a period of 120 days but, after multiple extensions, Russia pulled out in July 2023, claiming key parts of the agreement had not been implemented.",Positive

Unique two-clawed dinosaur discovered Duonychus is one of the few species of theropod dinosaur that evolved two-fingered hands.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn7v3eln56no,"– A rare new species of two-clawed dinosaur has been discovered by scientists in Mongolia's Gobi Desert. The species, named Duonychus tsogtbaatari, was unique within a group of dinosaurs called Therizinosaurs, which stood on their hind legs and usually had three claws.It was medium-sized, with an estimated weight of approximately 260kg.Researchers believe the species' long, curved claws and its ability to strongly flex them would have made it an efficient grasper of vegetation.Besides better grasping, the two-fingered hands may have been used for display, digging, or as formidable weapons.The most famous two-fingered theropods are species within the group tyrannosaurids, which includes Tyrannosaurus rex, but Duonychus evolved its two-fingered hands separately from them and from other two-fingered theropods.The specimen was recovered from the Bayanshiree formation in the Gobi Desert of Mongolia, which dates back to the Late Cretaceous period (between 100.5 to 66 million years ago).Unesco, the UN's Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, calls the Mongolian Gobi Desert the largest dinosaur fossil reservoir in the world.",Positive

US drops bounties on key Taliban leaders The move comes days after US officials met with the Taliban government to secure the release of an American tourist.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1enxv4vz7do,"– The US has removed millions of dollars in bounties from senior members of the Haqqani militant network in Afghanistan, including one on its leader Sirajuddin Haqqani who is also the Taliban government's interior minister.It is a significant move given that the Haqqani network is accused of carrying out some of the most high-profile and deadly attacks in Afghanistan during the US-led war in the country, including attacks on the American and Indian embassies, and NATO forces.Currently, the network is a key part of the Taliban government, which has controlled Afghanistan since foreign troops withdrew from the country in 2021, following a deal struck between the US and the Taliban during President Trump's first term.The move to lift the bounties comes weeks into President Trump's second term, and just days after US officials met with the Taliban government in Kabul to secure the release of an American tourist, detained since 2022.It is unclear if lifting the bounties was a part of the negotiations.The FBI webpage, which on Monday showed a $10 million dollar bounty on Sirajuddin Haqqani, has now been updated to remove the reward offer.Taliban interior ministry spokesman Abdul Mateen Qani told the BBC that the lifting of bounties ""was a result of continued diplomatic efforts"" by his government.",Negative

Officials in Greenland have fiercely criticized the planned visits as disrespectful.Dr Dwayne Ryan Menezes, founder and managing director of Polar Research and Policy Initiative think tank, based in London, criticized the visit.He said it is ""highly unusual"" that a high-level delegation of US officials are visiting Greenland without being invited, especially after a national election in the country, where the parties are still in talks to form the next government.In a video posted on social media platform X, Vance said there was a lot of excitement around his wife's trip to Greenland.He said the visit to the military installation was to check on the island's security, as ""a lot of other countries have threatened Greenland, have threatened to use its territories and its waterways to threaten the United States, to threaten Canada, and of course, to threaten the people of Greenland.""He added that the Trump administration wants to ""reinvigorate the security of the people of Greenland"", and that the United States and Denmark have ignored it for ""far too long.""",Positive
Trump signs order aimed at overhauling US elections,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cdxq37nxl55o,"– President Trump has signed an executive order that aims to overhaul US federal elections, including by requiring voters to show proof of citizenship and limiting when states can receive mail-in ballots.Experts warn the move could disenfranchise millions of Americans who do not have easy access to a passport or other legal documents proving they have the right to vote.It is unclear how enforceable the order is, given US states have wide legal leeway to determine how they run their elections. The order also seeks to bar states from accepting mail ballots received after election day.Currently, 18 states allow ballots to be received after election day as long as they were mailed on or before the day of the vote.The order would withdraw federal funding for US states that do not comply.Trump has been accused of spreading election misinformation, including by claiming that ""millions"" of illegal immigrants voted in his first election campaign.",Negative
