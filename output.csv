Anton's testimony offers an insight into the top-secret inner workings of the nuclear forces in Russia.The BBC is unable to independently verify all the events he described, although they do with Russian statements at the time. Anton says that combat alert was in place on day one of the war and claims his unit was ""shut inside the base."" Anton was part of the base's security unit—a rapid-reaction force that guarded the nuclear weapons.The doctrine now says Russia can launch if it comes under ""massive attack"" from conventional missiles by a non-nuclear state but ""with the participation or support of a nuclear state.""Senior officers reprimanded Anton by transferring him to a regular assault brigade in another part of the country. Anton says he was told he would be sent to war.These units are often sent in to battle as the ""first wave"" and a number of Russian deserters have told the BBC that ""troublemakers"" who object to the war have been used as ""cannon fodder.""The Kremlin has been doing all it can to test the West's nerves.Only last week Putin ratified changes to the nuclear doctrine - the official rules dictating how and when Russia can launch nuclear weapons.",Negative
