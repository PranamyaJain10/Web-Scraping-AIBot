"Myanmar quake toll passes 1,600 as people dig for survivors with bare hands An acute lack of equipment, patchy communications and wrecked roads are hampering the search for survivors.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5y0y1py7ppo,"– More than 1,600 people have died following the devastating earthquake in Myanmar, with locals in some areas telling the BBC they had been left to dig through rubble for survivors with their bare hands.The quake has flattened much of Mandalay—the ancient capital and second-largest city which is home to about 1.5 million people.An acute lack of equipment, patchy communication networks and wrecked roads and bridges have hampered the search. Myanmar's military government or junta, which seized power in 2021, is also no longer in control of much of the country after a four-year civil war against rebel groups and an anti-coup resistance.Although rescue efforts have been under way since Friday and international aid has begun to enter the country, help is yet to reach the worst-hit areas and ordinary people have been trying to dig survivors out by hand.Widely shared footage shows two men moving rubble to pry out a young woman trapped between two concrete slabs.The BBC has spoken to locals who said that people were screaming for help from under the debris.The junta has put the number of damaged buildings in the Mandalay region, the epicentre of the earthquake, at more than 1,500.Power outages have exacerbated the situation, and according to officials restoring power could take days.Mandalay airport is not functional as the runways were damaged during the earthquake.",Negative
"Myanmar junta bombing rebels hours after devastating quake A UN Special Rapporteur tells BBC it is ""nothing short of incredible"" that the military would ""drop bombs when you are trying to rescue people"".",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy7x7r8m3xlo,"– The military junta has continued to bomb parts of the war-torn country following the major earthquake there, which has killed more than 1,600 people.The UN has described the attacks as ""completely outrageous and unacceptable.""Special Rapporteur Tom Andrews told the BBC that it was ""nothing short of incredible"" that the military was continuing to ""drop bombs when you are trying to rescue people"" after the earthquake.He called on the military regime, which seized power in a coup nearly four years ago to stop all military operations.""Anyone who has influence on the military needs to step up the pressure and make it very clear that this is not acceptable,"" he said.The military's aerial warfare is being sustained by continued support from Russia and China.Despite UN calls for an arms embargo in response to the coup, both China and Russia have sold the junta sophisticated attack jets and provided training on how to use it.China and China have also now sent aid and rescue teams into Myanmar.But UK-based Burmese rights activist Julie Khine said: ""It's hard to trust the sympathy now, when they're also the same countries supplying the military junta with deadly weapons used to kill our innocent civilians.""What we know from past humanitarian disasters, natural disasters, is that the junta does not reveal the truth.Myanmar's military has a longstanding practice of denying aid to areas where resistance groups are active.The National Unity Government (NUG), which represents the ousted civilian administration, said in a statement that its armed forces would begin a two-week pause in ""offensive military operations, except for defensive actions"" in areas affected by the earthquake, from Sunday.",Negative
Chair of charity Harry quit calls prince's brand 'toxic' The Duke of Sussex left his role with Sentebale after the relationship between its trustees and chair broke down.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/crldrrxz33ro,"– The head of a charity co-founded by the Duke of Sussex has called his brand ""toxic"" and claimed it hindered the group, after he and several others quit the organization earlier this week. Speaking to the Financial Times, Sentebale chairwoman Dr Sophie Chandauka said she first felt tensions with Prince Harry a year ago.Dr Chandauka separately told Sky News the way the duke handled his departure from the charity - set up in 2006 in honor of mother Diana to help people in southern Africa living with HIV and Aids - amounted to ""harassment and bullying at scale.""A source close to the former trustees and patrons said they ""fully expected this publicity stunt.""Harry has said he, and co-founder Prince Seeiso of Lesotho, stepped down because the relationship between the charity's trustees and Dr Chandauka ""broke down beyond repair.""But Dr Chandauka strongly defended her record as chair, adding: ""The number-one risk for this organization was the toxicity of its lead patron's brand.""Harry quit charity he set up in Diana's honor over internal rowWhy leaving his own charity will matter so much to Prince HarryWhy did Prince Harry leave his own charity?Dr Chandauka, who was on Sentebale's board before becoming chair, accused Prince Harry of wanting ""to force a failure and then come to the rescue.""",Positive
"No survivors after plane crashes into house in Minnesota Officials said it was unclear how many people were onboard the plane, but the local fire chief has said that no one survived.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3evj8w8vy1o,"– A small plane flying from Iowa to Minnesota in the US crashed into a suburban home and caused it to catch on fire, officials said on Saturday.The plane had taken off around 1220 local time (1720 BST) before crashing in a residential area of Brooklyn Park, Minnesota, the Federal Aviation Administration said.Investigators said it was unclear how many people were onboard the plane, but Brooklyn Park Fire Chief Shawn Conway said there were no survivors among the passengers.The National Transportation Safety Board said it intended to investigate the cause of the crash, which remained unknown.The agency is enroute to the scene in Minnesota.It said it expected to be on the ground on Sunday.""Once on site, the investigators will begin the process of documenting the scene and examining the aircraft.The aircraft will then be recovered to a secure facility for further evaluation,"" the agency said in a statement.Videos on social media show that the home the plane crashed into was engulfed by flames as members of the local fire department attempted to put it out.The city of 82,000 people lies about 11 miles to the north.",Negative
Protesters return to Istanbul's streets for huge rally Pro-democracy protesters gathered in support of jailed opposition leader Ekrem Imamoglu.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4g3eer4737o,"– Hundreds of thousands of pro-democracy demonstrators have returned to the streets of Istanbul, Turkey, in support of the city's jailed mayor.Ekrem Imamoglu, who is seen as the main rival of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, was arrested on corruption charges last week, sparking mass protests.He denies the charges and claims his arrest is politically motivated. Saturday's crowds were so large that they spilled from the site of the protest into a neighboring park.The chairman of Imamoglu's Republican People's Party addressed demonstrators, reading out a letter from the jailed politician who is being held in solitary confinement.Imamoglu's wife, Dilek, was also at the protest and told the crowd: ""We will keep fighting and fighting.""Protesters waved Turkey's red-and-white flags and chanted: ""Rights, law, justice!""Imamoglu has served as Istanbul's mayor since 2019 and won a resounding victory in mayoral elections last year.He has been named as the CHP's candidate for the presidential election due in 2028 and is widely viewed as the only politician capable of challenging Erdogan and his Justice and Development Party at the ballot box.Erdogan has been in power for more than two decades, first as prime minister then as president from 2014.",Negative
"Kink and LGBT dating apps exposed 1.5m private user images online The often-explicit pictures are being stored without password protection, leaving them vulnerable to a hack.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c05m5m5v327o,"– Researchers have discovered nearly 1.5 million pictures from specialist dating apps—many of which are explicit—being stored online without password protection, leaving them vulnerable to hackers and extortionists.Anyone with the link was able to view the private photos from five platforms developed by M.A.D Mobile: kink sites BDSM People and Chica, and LGBT apps Pink, Brish and Translove.These services are used by an estimated 800,000 to 900,000 people.M.A.D Mobile was first warned about the security flaw on 20th January but didn't take action until the BBC emailed on Friday.They have since fixed it but not said how it happened or why they failed to protect the sensitive images. Ethical hacker Aras Nazarovas from Cybernews first alerted the firm about the security hole after finding the location of the online storage used by the apps by analyzing the code that powers the services.He was shocked that he could access the unencrypted and unprotected photos without any password.The first app I investigated was BDSM People, and the first image in the folder was a naked man in his thirties.The images were not limited to those from profiles, he said—they included pictures which had been sent privately in messages, and even some which had been removed by moderators.Mr Nazarovas said the discovery of unprotected sensitive material comes with a significant risk for the platforms' users.Malicious hackers could have found the images and extorted individuals.There is also a risk to those who live in countries hostile to LGBT people.None of the text content of private messages was found to be stored in this way and the images are not labelled with user names or real names, which would make crafting targeted attacks at users more complex.In an email M.A.D Mobile said it was grateful to the researcher for uncovering the vulnerability in the apps to prevent a data breach from occurring.",Negative
"Israel-Hamas ceasefire back on table in new negotiations Hamas reportedly agrees to proposals sent by mediators, while Israel offers its counter-proposal.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4g9x0kd4gro,"– Israeli forces launched a ground operation in Rafah and continued air strikes across Gaza Strip after a ceasefire which had come into force on 19 January ended earlier this month.Both sides had been unable to agree to a second phase of the deal after the first ended.Khalil al-Hayyam, the most senior Hamas leader outside Gaza, said the group had approved a draft deal sent by Egyptian and Qatari mediators.Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office said it had also received the plan, and submitted a ""counter-proposal to the mediators in full co-ordination with the United States.""The war was triggered when Hamas attacked southern Israel on 7 October 2023, killing about 1,200 people and taking 251 back to Gaza as captives.Israel responded with a massive military offensive, which killed more than 50,000 Palestinians, Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry says.Meanwhile, the relatives of the remaining hostages have accused Netanyahu of putting hostage lives in danger by breaking the ceasefire.One of those hostages, Elkana Bohbot, was shown in a new video posted by Hamas in which he begs for his release.",Negative
The US firms backing Trump's fight over trade Businesses think Trump is right about unfair trade. But are the US President's reciprocal tariffs the answer?,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c04z0ydvql2o,"– President Trump's plan for reciprocal tariffs will help remedy such grievances, pumping up his announcement as ""Liberation Day."" But even the businesses seeking action on their own issues have expressed hesitation about the president's tariff-first, ask-questions-later strategy, which risks retaliation and a wider trade war.The White House itself spotlighted uneven ethanol tariffs in Brazil (18%, compared with 2.5% in the US), car tariffs in Europe (10%, compared with 2.5% in the US) and motorcycles in India (until a few years ago, 100% vs 2.4% in the US)",Negative
JD Vance's ominous pitch to Greenland,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cp3y3vdvdggo,"– A green shimmer, like a curtain of light being drawn across the night sky, formed beside the impossibly bright stars above Nuuk late on Friday evening.The appearance of the spectacular northern lights—a common wonder in these parts—seemed to mark the end of a hugely significant day in the arctic, one that brought icebound Greenland's hopes and challenges into the sharpest relief.It was a day in which an acquisitive foreign power had sent an uninvited delegation to the world's largest island with an uncomfortable message.On a brief visit to a remote US military base in the far north of Greenland, US Vice-President JD Vance may have tried at times to soften his boss's stated aim of simply annexing the autonomous Danish territory.""We do not think that military force is ever going to be necessary,"" Vance said, perhaps attempting to sound reassuring.But the vice-president's overarching message remained stark and intimidating: the world, the climate, and the Arctic region are changing fast, and Greenland needs to wake up to threats posed by an expansionist China; long-standing Western security partnerships have run their course; the only way the island can protect itself, its values and its mineral wealth is by abandoning weak and miserly Danish overlords and turning instead to the muscular and protective embrace of the US.",Positive
Taliban releases detained US citizen Faye Hall,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c934pp6w3v6o,"– An American citizen, who was held by the Taliban in Afghanistan for two months, has been released, Washington's former envoy to Kabul has said.Faye Hall will ""soon be heading home"" after she was arrested by the Taliban in February, Zalmay Khalilzad, who served as the US special representative for Afghanistan from 2018-2021, wrote on X.Ms Hall, who is now in the care of Qatari officials, was detained alongside a British couple in their seventies - Barbie and Peter Reynolds - and their interpreter.The couple ran training programs for women and girls, and stayed when the Taliban retook control of Afghanistan in 2021. Afghan officials have not made the reason for their arrest public.Ms Hall was arrested while traveling with the couple to their home in central Bamyan province.Ms Entwistle has said that her 79-year-old father is suffering severe medical issues while imprisoned, including a chest infection, eye infections, and digestive issues.Our desperate appeal to the Taliban is that they release them to their home, where they have the medication he needs to survive,"" she told the Sunday Times.Ms Hall is the fourth US citizen released by the Taliban since January after Qatar brokered an agreement with them.",Negative
