"Rosenberg: Is Putin's 'Easter truce' cause for scepticism or chance for peace? Ukraine and Russia have accused each other of violating a 30-hour truce, but it comes as diplomatic efforts pick up, Russia Editor Steve Rosenberg writes.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy70vj2eejzo,"– Is Russia's Easter ceasefire simply PR from Vladimir Putin?Or does it represent a genuine step towards ending the war?The sceptical view is that a 30-hour truce is less about pushing for peace and has more to do with maintaining good relations with the Trump White House.However, recent public comments by American officials (including Trump himself) have suggested that the US administration has been growing impatient with the lack of progress on Ukraine.By announcing a unilateral truce - albeit a short one - the Kremlin can argue that it is Russia - not Ukraine - that is committed to peace.Keep in mind, this brief ceasefire was declared at very short notice.The Russian military also accused Ukraine of violating the ceasefire.The sceptical view is that a 30-hour truce is less about pushing for peace and has more to do with maintaining good relations with the Trump White House.However, recent public comments by American officials (including Trump himself) have suggested that the US administration has been growing impatient with the lack of progress on Ukraine.",Positive
"A death every three minutes: Why India's roads are among the world's deadliest India's roads claimed over 172,000 lives in 2023 - averaging 474 deaths daily, or one every three minutes.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4g49pgx6d0o,"– Every morning, India's newspapers are filled with reports of road accidents—passenger buses plunging into mountain gorges, drunk drivers mowing down pedestrians, cars crashing into stationary trucks and two-wheelers being knocked down by larger vehicles.These daily tragedies underscore a silent crisis: in 2023 alone, more than 172,000 people lost their lives on Indian roads, averaging 474 deaths each day or nearly one every three minutes.Although the official crash report for 2023 has yet to be released, Road Transport and Highways Minister Nitin Gadkari cited the data to paint a grim picture at a road safety event in December.Gadkari told the road safety meeting that many road accidents happen because people lack respect and fear for the law.""There are several reasons for accidents, but the biggest is human behavior,"" he said.But that's only part of the picture.Despite efforts and investments, India's roads remain among the most unsafe in the world. road crashes impose a significant economic burden, costing India 3% of its annual GDP.",Negative
"'I was careful and followed instructions closely, but still lost my crypto' A customer's experience highlights issues dealing with cryptocurrency, where many regular banking safeguards do not apply.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c93gydxj8n7o,"– Trading cryptocurrency was just a bit of fun for Tzoni Raykov, but losing $1,500 worth to an administrative error has left him with serious concerns about his treatment by the industry.The oil engineer has held an account with Revolut for several years—using its app to split bills with friends after going out for dinner or drinks.But after seeing the e-money firm advertise its cryptocurrency services, he decided to give it a try.What Tzoni thought would be a straightforward transfer of cryptocurrency coins has left the Bulgarian national angry and out of pocket.Tzoni says the problem occurred because Revolut's deposit instructions were unclear.When you transfer cryptocurrency from one account to another, you have to select a network to send it through—like choosing which courier service to use when sending a parcel.Revolut's deposit instructions say to transfer USDC to it, you have to use a network called Polygon.In his first, successful, deposit Tzoni selected one called ""Polygon PoS.""In the second deposit, when he tried to transfer 1,500 USDC, he selected a different network—Polygon (bridged)"".He thought it would work just as well but says instead it caused the coins to be converted into USDC.e—a different cryptocurrency.Revolut told us the deposit ultimately failed because the USDC.e coins it received were not supported by the company's technology.It said: ""As is standard industry practice due to the significant technical challenges involved in supporting every combination of token and chain, the recovery of these unsupported assets does not sit within Revolut's scope.""It means the 1,500 USDC.e coins have not been credited to Tzoni's account or sent back to him.To Tzoni's mind, this isn't acceptable treatment from a company of Revolut's size and reputation, which handles normal banking deposits as well as cryptocurrency, stocks and commodities.",Negative

Could an almighty eruption destroy a dreamy Greek island? Scientists are investigating for the first time how dangerous the island's next big one could be.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cm25lz56rezo,"– Beneath the idyllic white villages dotted with gyros restaurants, hot tubs in AirBnB rentals, and vineyards on rich volcanic soil, two tectonic plates grind in the Earth's crust.Prof Isobel Yeo, an expert on highly dangerous submarine volcanoes with Britain's National Oceanography Centre, is leading the mission.It's a bit like 'out of sight, out of mind' in terms of understanding their danger, compared to more famous ones like Vesuvius,"" she says on deck, as we watch two engineers winching a robot the size of a car off the ship's side.The two volcanoes are not expected to erupt imminently, but it is only a matter of time.The expedition will create data sets and geohazard maps for Greece's Civil Protection Agency, explains Prof Paraskevi Nomikou, a member of the government emergency group that met daily during the earthquake crisis.The volcano inspired her to become a geologist.""This research is very important because it will inform local people how active the volcanoes are, and it will map the area that will be forbidden to access during an eruption,"" she says.So far, no one has been able to work out if a volcano becomes more or less explosive when sea water in these vents mixes with magma.The Hunga Tunga eruption in 2022 in the Pacific produced the largest underwater explosion ever recorded, and created a tsunami in the Atlantic with shockwaves felt in the UK.Some islands in Tonga, near the volcano, were so devastated that their people have never returned.The Discovery is investigating Santorini's caldera and sailing out to Kolombo, the other major volcano in this area, about 7km (4.3 miles north-east of the island.)",Negative
