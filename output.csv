What are the worst-case scenarios? The BBC's James Landale looks at what could happen if the fighting escalates and expands.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c74n23y1x48o,"– Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has long been accused of wanting to drag the US into helping him defeat Iran. Military analysts say only the US has the bombers and bunker-busting bombs that can penetrate the deepest of Iranian nuclear facilities, especially that of Fordow. Iran could strike US targets across the Middle East—such as special forces camps in Iraq, military bases in the Gulf, and diplomatic missions in the region. But if America were to become an active combatant, that would represent a huge escalation with a long, potentially devastating consequential tail. Iran is reeling from Israel's unprecedented attack—and it is only the startIsrael has inflicted unprecedented damage on Iran's elite—why now? If Iran failed to damage Israel's well-protected military and other targets, then it could always aim its missiles at softer targets in the Gulf, especially countries that Iran believes aided and abetted its enemies over the years.",Negative

The strikes have killed the commander of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), the chief of staff of the armed forces, and many other high-ranking IRGC chiefs, and the Israeli attack is not yet over. Iran retaliated in the afternoon, with the Revolutionary Guard saying it carried out attacks against ""dozens of targets, military centers and airbases.""The situation escalated quickly and after Iran's retaliatory missile attacks, Netanyahu said, ""More is on the way."" Israel may calculate that the attacks and killings could unsettle the regime and open the way for a popular uprising.Iran is reeling from Israel's unprecedented attack—and it is only the start There's also the Mujahideen-e Khalq (MEK), an exiled opposition group that backs the overthrow of the Islamic Republic but is against going back to the monarchy.However, those events didn't even come close to the level of destruction during Friday's attacks.Iran doesn't seem to have many good options.Some might see the safest way out as continuing to engage in negotiations with MEK.",Negative

Officials say the couple fled the museum before staff noticed what happened.They have since notified police about the pair, who have not been identified.Of course it was an accident, but these two people left without speaking to us - that isn't an accident,"" says museum director Vanessa Carlon.The Palazzo Maffei opened in 2020 and has 650 pieces on display, including paintings by Picasso and ancient Egyptian art.Ms Carlon says the majority of visitors are considerate, and she hopes this release of CCTV footage won't become a ""negative episode.""The chair was built by Italian artist Nicola Bolla and is bejewelled with Swarovski crystals made from polished, machine-cut glass.It is named after Vincent van Gogh as a tribute to the Dutch artist's painting of a simple chair.Bolla's piece is somewhat priceless, in that the museum declined to provide an estimate of its value when asked by the BBC.Carlotta Menegazzo, an art historian based at the Palazzo Maffei, says that—while it looks sturdy—its frame is mostly hollow and kept together with foil.Two legs and the main seat were broken, but Ms Menegazzo says ""a great job"" has been done to restore the piece and it is now back in place.",Positive
"Israel-Iran conflict set to dominate G7 summit Instead of Ukraine and Donald Trump's tariff war, the main subject of discussion for world leaders will be the Middle East.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cpvk9rj73zdo,"– This week's G7 summit in Canada will be dominated by war—only not one of those that the world leaders had expected.High on the agenda had been Russia's war against Ukraine and Donald Trump's tariff war against America's trading partners.Instead the three-day gathering in the Rocky Mountains of Alberta will inevitably be focused on war in the Middle East.Israel's decision to attack Iran will force the Group of Seven western powers to spend less time on other issues and instead discuss ways of managing the conflict.Like so many of their discussions, that will involve Britain, France, Germany and Italy—along with Canada and Japan—seeking to influence the United States.For although Israel might have launched these strikes without explicit American support, the US president is the only leader with real leverage over Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.Other leaders also attending the summit, from Mexico, India, Australia, South Africa, South Korea and Brazil, are not expected to pick a fight.Max Bergmann, director of the Europe, Russia and Eurasia Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said: ""The question now is not so much 'is this an awkward family gathering?' That's almost a given. I think the question is: 'is this still a family?'""",Negative
