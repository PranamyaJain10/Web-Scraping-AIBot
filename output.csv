"Jeremy Bowen: Israel's allies see evidence of war crimes in Gaza mounting up The Middle East has been transformed since 7 October, and almost two years on, the conflict in Gaza is at another inflection point.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cp863mln0pmo,"– Two years ago, Hamas was putting the finishing touches to its plan to attack Israel. In Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu believed that the Palestinians were a problem to be managed. In Washington, then-President Joe Biden and his administration believed they were close to hatching a deal between the Saudis and Israelis.It was all a series of illusions. Netanyahu has refused to establish an enquiry to look into the mistakes he made alongside his army and security chiefs that gave Hamas its opportunity to attack with such deadly effect on 7 October 2023.The century-long conflict between Jews and Arabs for control of the land between the River Jordan and the Mediterranean was unresolved, festering, and about to explode into a war that looks to be as consequential as its other landmarks, in 1948 and 1967.The Middle East has been transformed since 7 October when Hamas attacked, and almost two years into the war, the conflict in Gaza is at another inflection point. Allies who rallied around after the 7 October Hamas attacks have lost patience with Israel's conduct in Gaza.Even Israel's most important ally, Donald Trump, is reported to be losing patience with Netanyahu after being taken by surprise when the Israeli leader ordered the bombing of Damascus—attacking Syria's new regime, which Trump has recognized and encouraged.Other western allies of Israel ran out of patience months ago.Another joint statement, condemning Israel's actions, was signed on 21 July by foreign ministers from the UK, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and Japan.It was not enough for Labour MPs, who want strong words to be backed by strong actions.",Negative

US House speaker shuts down chamber to block Epstein vote,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cgjg9j0l7j9o,"– President Trump said interviewing Maxwell ""sounds appropriate to do"" adding: ""I don't know anything about it.""
