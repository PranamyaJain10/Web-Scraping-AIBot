Three big unknowns ahead of Trump's 'Liberation Day' tariffs The president is expected to unveil details of his plans for a wider set of import taxes. But what tariffs and when?,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0m90jjewd7o,"– Donald Trump says tariffs are coming. That message from the US president has been consistent.But what tariffs and when? import taxes have come so thick and fast since he took office that it can be hard to keep track. Trump has already raised duties on Chinese imports, steel, aluminium and some goods from Canada and Mexico. Higher levies on cars are due to go into effect this week.On Sunday, the president said the new tariffs could apply to ""all countries"", suggesting a possible return to the across-the-board tariff he backed in the campaign.It dashed hopes in some countries, such as the UK, that thought they might float under the radar, though many are still hoping eventually to work out some sort of deal.Trump himself has reserved some of his harshest criticism for historic allies and major trade partners, such as Canada and the EU.""Friend has been, oftentimes, much worse than foe,"" he declared last week.The Office of the US Trade Representative, as it prepared to craft recommendations, identified the countries in which it was ""particularly interested.""It has a led to a scramble, as businesses and political leaders try to get a sense of how big a new tax their products might be facing; and how whatever is announced on Wednesday will interact with other duties, such as those on steel and aluminium, already put into effect by Trump.The White House has not said how high the tariffs could go, although various possible rates have been floated by analysts.On the campaign trail last year, Trump backed a 10% across-the-the-board tariff on all imports coming into the US, sometimes suggesting that could be 20% - even 60% on imports from China.",Negative

The man mourning 170 loved ones lost in Myanmar's earthquake Scores of Muslims died in Sagaing when their mosques collapsed during Friday prayers at the end of Ramadan.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cm2e98xep10o,"– As the call to prayer rang out in Sagaing last Friday, hundreds of Muslims hurried to the five mosques in central Myanmar.They were eager to hold their last Friday prayers for Ramadan, just days away from the festive period of Eid that would mark the end of the holy month.Hundreds of people have sought shelter by the side of the road, either because they are now homeless, or are too afraid to go back to their homes in case there are aftershocks.More than 2,700 people have died in the quake which happened near Sagaing and Mandalay, Myanmar's second city.The death toll is expected to rise as rescuers continue to pull out bodies from rubble.The former imam of Myoma mosque, Soe Nay Oo, felt the quake in the Thai border town of Mae Sot.He currently lives in the Thai city of Mae Sot with his wife and daughter, after escaping from Myanmar soon after a coup that took place in 2021.Some of the close friends who died include Soe Nay Oo's former assistant imam, whom he remembered for his strong work ethic and remarkable talent in reciting the Quran.The principal of the local public school, who was also the only female trustee of the Myoma mosque, also died.She was the one who showed her love to us the most.He said every time he hears of yet another person from the community who died, he experiences a new wave of grief.",Positive
Peter Dutton: The ex-cop who brought Australia's opposition back from the brink Peter Dutton is one of Australia's most experienced politicians - but also one of its most polarising.,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-australia-45254762,"– ""I have seen the wonderful, kind nature of people willing to offer any assistance to those in their worst hour, and I have seen the sickening behavior displayed by people who, frankly, barely justify their existence in our sometimes over-tolerant society."" Peter Dutton vowed to fight for the ""forgotten people"" of Australia who were ""fed up"" with the ""boisterous minority and the politically correct""—a stance he has steadfastly clung to during his climb to the top of the Liberal-National coalition.The 54-year-old is now gearing up to fight the upcoming May election on many of those same battlegrounds.Sometimes to Donald Trump in both policy and rhetoric—a comparison he rejects—Dutton's hard-line brand of conservativism and combative statements have often stirred controversy and made him one of Australian politics' most polarising figures.But he's also one of its most experienced, with 20 years as an MP under his belt, many of them spent as a senior minister handling key portfolios like health, immigration, defense and home affairs.Dutton took over leadership of the Coalition after its worst defeat in 70 years, but in only one term has made it competitive again, a feat even some on his side of the aisle had thought impossible.Dutton quickly climbed the ladder, landing his first ministerial position within three years, and by the time the Coalition returned to power under Tony Abbott in 2013, he was one of the leading conservative voices in the party.He has taken on an array of portfolios, but it is in immigration, home affairs and defense where he really cemented his reputation.""I was impressed by him from the word go,"" Howard—Australia's second longest-serving leader—who would go on to become Dutton's role model and mentor.",Positive
"The influencers who want America to procreate faster - and believe the White House is on their side This fringe group have long courted controversy - but since Trump was sworn in for the second time earlier this year, their evangelising has reached a new level",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5ypdy05jl9o,"– The US is at a record low of 1.62 children per woman, and by the end of the century the UN projects a majority of countries will have a shrinking population. But pronatalists are buoyed by this and many hope it is a sign of things to come.""We are a coalition of people who are incredibly different in our philosophies, our theological beliefs, our family structures,"" says Malcolm. But the one thing we agree on is that our core enemy is the urban monoculture; the leftist unifying culture.""So, could this fringe group really gain the ear of some of the most powerful people in the US government? And if so, just how much soft power could they have to influence policy not only around population decline but about wider issues too?""",Positive
Florida Republican defeats Democrat in US House special election The result dashes Democrats' hopes of pulling off a major upset in a district Donald Trump carried last November.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx20kzrlnjgo,"– Republican State Senator Randy Fine has defeated Democrat Josh Weil in a closely watched special Florida congressional election to fill the seat held by National Security Advisor Michael Waltz.The result dashes Democratic hopes of pulling what would have been a stunning upset in a district that Donald Trump carried by 30 points in last November's presidential election.The narrow margin of Fine's victory on Tuesday, however, is likely to leave Republicans uneasy about their prospects in next year's national mid-term congressional elections.Democrat Weil, a strong Gaza supporter who clashed with Fine's anti-Palestinian stance, made waves by raising more than $12m in campaign donations, compared to the approximately $1m brought in by his opponent.That disparity, along with polls that showed a contest within the margin of error, had put this congressional race in the national spotlight.Republicans still hold only a narrow majority in the House of Representatives after Tuesday's results, but it appears to be a sustainable margin through next year's election, improving what would have been gloomy prospects of advancing Trump's legislative agenda if Fine had been defeated.",Positive

Trump poised to reshape global economy and how world does business The option of a 20% universal tariff is the only way to get to some of the massive revenues of trillions of dollars claimed by some of his advisers.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c99pvll3ne3o,"– President Trump has been adamant that the tariffs will be ""reciprocal"" and the US will be ""nicer"" to its trade partners.Today, he will reveal in the White House Rose Garden not just how serious he is about ""the most beautiful word in the dictionary"", but effectively call time on decades of economic globalisation.And it is still possible that he will do this by launching the equivalent of a salvo of ballistic missiles into the global trading system, with a universal tariff on all imports into the USA.The option of a 20% universal tariff is the only way to get to some of the massive revenues of trillions of dollars claimed by some of his advisers.As the Vice President JD Vance said in a speech last month, globalisation has failed in the eyes of this administration because the idea was that ""rich countries would move further up the value chain, while the poor countries made the simpler things.""It is still possible that he will do this by launching the equivalent of a salvo of ballistic missiles into the global trading system, with a universal tariff on all imports into the USA.What starts later today is designed not just to reshape America, and trade, but the way the world itself has been run.As that has not panned out, especially in the case of China, the US is moving away from this world.If the US overplays its hand in alienating its allies today, China will be waiting.",Positive

Massive layoffs begin at top US health agency,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c209j2j4nxlo,"– Hundreds of federal health workers early on Tuesday learned their jobs had been cut, with many turned away at their office building doors, as the Department of Health and Human Services moved forward with its mass restructuring plan.The layoffs included several top officials and affected agencies responsible for overseeing the nation's food and drug safety, as well as those fighting disease.Health Secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr announced last week that 10,000 workers would be laid off, and through voluntary departures, the workforce would be reduced from 80,000 to 60,000.President Donald Trump has worked since inauguration day with adviser Elon Musk to slash the federal payroll.The White House said last week that it planned to cut 3,500 full-time employees at the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and 2,400 workers from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).The administration has said it is cutting 1,200 employees from the National Institutes of Health, as well.The layoffs included several top officials and affected agencies responsible for overseeing the nation's food and drug safety, as well as those fighting disease.Health workers began hearing as early as 05:00 EDT (10:00 BST) on Tuesday that they were being dismissed.The division had hundreds of employees who worked with 33 states, primarily helping local health departments gather environmental health data and providing the public with information about hazards such as mercury and radon poisoning.Two weeks ago, Burt and other division staff took part in an exercise to evaluate how to respond to a nuclear or radiological incident.All those staff members have been let go, he said.While Burt was not shocked by the firing, others learned they had been laid off when they showed up to their offices and were unable to scan their badges to enter.The administration also fired FDA staff who were involved in the government's response to bird flu, according to Reuters.",Negative
