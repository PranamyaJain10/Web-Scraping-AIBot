Asian markets make gains after Trump pauses higher tariffs but hikes rate for China It comes after a historic rally on Wall Street as Trump paused higher tariffs on most of the world.,https://www.bbc.com/news/live/cn4jjw30d5qt,"– The US and Vietnam have agreed to start negotiations for a trade agreement and will consider removing as many non-tariff barriers as possible, the Vietnamese government said in a statement on Thursday.

The White House has said that going big on tariffs and then hitting the pause button, before entering negotiations with individual countries, was the plan all along. Here's where some major markets currently stand: ""The greater majority of countries have capitulated in the tariff war with President Trump and this has been extremely well received by the equity markets,"" said Peter McGuire from brokerage firm Trading.com. The US and Vietnam have agreed to start negotiations for a trade agreement and will consider removing as many non-tariff barriers as possible, the Vietnamese government said in a statement on Thursday.

"Trump steps back from cliff edge of all-out global trade war The US is now making nice – or at least nicer - with nations that had faced their retaliatory trade fire, writes Anthony Zurcher.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx255d13w13o,"– Donald Trump and his White House team had insisted they were fully committed to their decision to impose sweeping ""reciprocal"" tariffs on dozens of countries.But now that pause on higher tariff rates, with a few notable exceptions, is a reality.The White House has said that going big on tariffs and then hitting the pause button, before entering negotiations with individual countries, was the plan all along.It is difficult to ignore the investor panic, tumbling bond market, and growing chorus of Republican criticism and public disapproval that preceded the announcement.It didn't take long for Trump's aides—many of the same people who said he would never back down—to fan out and celebrate the president's move.Trade adviser Peter Navarro said Trump's tariff situation ""unfolded exactly the way it should"".""You clearly failed to see what President Trump is doing here,"" press secretary Karoline Leavitt told a crowd of gathered reporters.Earlier in the day, he was on Truth Social, urging people to ""BE COOL!"" and promising that ""everything is going to work out.""It is enough of a step down for the stock market to bounce back, however, and Trump is now leaning into a trade war with China which he hit with 125% tariffs.The big unknown, however, is whether Trump's actions over the past week—setting allies scrambling and threatening the established global order—will have made such a strategy more difficult to pursue.",Negative

Sen Hawley opened the hearing by saying Meta had ""stopped at absolutely nothing to prevent"" Wednesday's testimony by Ms Wynn-Williams, who joins Frances Haugen and Arturo Béjar as former employees who have spoken out against the social media giant.""Why is it that Facebook is so desperate to prevent this witness from telling what she knows?"" Hawley said.Ms Wynn-Williams says Meta told her that creating exceptions to the non-disparagement agreement would ""eat the rule.""The company added that she is not restricted from testifying before Congress.Mr Daniels said CEO Mark Zuckerberg has been public about the company's interest in offering its services in China, but added.Ms Wynn-Williams also alleged the parent company worked ""hand in glove"" with Beijing to build censorship tools aimed at silencing critics of the Chinese Community Party.",Positive

"Why Trump is hitting China on trade - and what might happen next There is much more to this than straightforward retaliation, writes John Sudworth, and it traces back to his first term.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c9qwwe9rdwlo,"– The 90-day pause on the higher ""retaliatory"" tariffs levied on dozens of countries still leaves a universal across-the-board tariff of 10% in place.But China—which ships everything from iPhones to children's toys and accounts for around 14% of all US imports—has been singled out for much harsher treatment with an eye-watering rate of 125%.Trump said the increase was due to Beijing's readiness to retaliate with its own 84% levy on US goods, a move the president described as showing a ""lack of respect.""But for a politician who first fought his way to the White House on the back of an anti-China message, there is much more to this than simple retaliation.For Trump, this is about the unfinished business of that first term in office.""We didn't have the time to do the right thing, which we're doing now,"" he told reporters.The aim is nothing less than the upending of an established system of global trade centered on China as the factory of the world, as well as the once widely held view that underpinned it—the idea that more of this trade was, in and of itself, a good thing.To understand just how central this is to the US president's thinking, you need to go back to the time before anyone ever thought of him as a possible candidate for office, let alone a likely winner.In 2012, when I first reported from Shanghai - China's business capital - increased trade with the country was seen by almost everyone—global business leaders, Chinese officials, visiting foreign governments and trade delegations and trade delegations, foreign correspondents and learned economists—as a no brainer.Its tight control over the information sphere means it will be unlikely to drop its barriers to American technology companies, for example.",Negative

"Adventurer's trek claim 'ignorant', say islanders",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4g375ke65xo,"– An adventurer who claimed to be the first woman to solo traverse Canada's largest island has been criticized for her ""privilege and ignorance.""Camilla Hempleman-Adams, from Wiltshire, covered 150 miles (241km) on foot and by ski across Baffin Island, Nunavut, completing the journey on 27 March.However, members of the native Inuit population said her claim was incorrect and came from a ""dangerous colonial attitude"", with people there having traveled the same route for generations.The daughter of adventurer Sir David Hempleman-Adams has since apologized, adding: ""It was never my intention to misrepresent any historical achievements or cause distress to local communities."" The solo trek across Baffin Island took Ms Hempleman-Adams from Qikiqtarjuaq to Pangnirtung, crossing through Auyuittuq National Park.Ahead of departure, she wrote on her expedition website: ""Parks Canada has confirmed that there are no historical records of a female solo attempt from Qikiqtarjuaq to Pangnirtung.""But Gayle Uyagaqi Kabloona, who is Inuit and based in Ottawa, said this was because crossing the terrain is considered ""a normal way of life"" for them.The danger is going back with this colonial attitude and disseminating information like the Inuit don't have history there.It was almost like she was bringing back news of a new continent to Europe and saying 'there's nobody here!'
