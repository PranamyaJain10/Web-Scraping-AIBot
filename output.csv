Judge questions White House's refusal to turn around deportation flights The Trump administration has argued that the judge overstepped his powers and that it has followed the law.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/crrdp9jdpyko,"– A US federal court judge has questioned why the Trump administration failed to obey his order halting the deportations of alleged Venezuelan gang members.James Boasberg, the top federal judge in Washington DC, ordered deportation flights to be turned around on Saturday night.White House officials argued in a court filing that it did not defy the ruling, arguing in part that because Boasberg's order was made orally rather than in written form, it was not enforceable - and that the planes had already left the US by the time it was issued.During a hearing Monday, Boasberg said he clearly ordered the government to turn the planes around.He cited the Alien Enemies Act - legislation dating to 1798 that allows non-citizens to be deported in wartime.The act was last used during World War II, when it was invoked to arrest and deport citizens of Axis countries.Campaign groups have questioned Trump's justification.The act was used as the basis to deport 137 of the total 261 people who were deported, the White House said on Monday.The dispute began over the weekend when a group of 238 alleged Venezuelan gang members, plus 23 alleged members of the international MS-13 gang, were sent from the US to a prison in El Salvador.The White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said: ""The administration did not'refuse to comply' with a court order.""Neither the US government nor El Salvador has named those who have been deported, or provided details of their alleged criminality or gang membership.Several relatives of men believed to be among the group told the New York Times that their loved ones did not have gang ties.The White House, for its part, has insisted that authorities are ""sure"" that the detainees were gang members, based on intelligence.Trump's border tsar, Tom Homan, told reporters at the White House on Monday that Trump did ""exactly the right thing"".""The plane was already over international waters with a plane full of terrorists and significant public safety threats.""I think we're in very dangerous territory here in very dangerous territory here in the United States with the invocation of this law,"" he said.",Negative
"Trump warns Iran will face 'dire' consequences unless Houthi attacks stop The US president says Iran's leadership would be blamed for ""every shot fired by the Houthis"".",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwyd2l17ygpo,"– US President Donald Trump has warned Iran that it will face ""dire"" consequences if Yemen's Houthis continue to attack international shipping lanes.He said the Iranian leadership would from now on be viewed as having pulled the trigger for ""every shot fired by the Houthis"", which have long been backed by Tehran.The Pentagon said it had struck 30 targets in Yemen since Saturday, in the biggest US military operation in the Middle East since Trump returned to the White House.

Why is China spending billions to get people to open their wallets? Beijing hopes better wages and discounts can enocurage spending and stave off greater economic trouble.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx2gk8j06r0o,"– The Chinese government has promised new child care subsidies, increased wages, and better paid leave to revive a slowing economy.That is on top of a $41bn discount program for all sorts of things, from dishwashers and home decor to electric vehicles and smartwatches.The near-collapse of the property market has also made Chinese consumers more risk-averse, leading them to cut back on spending.""Household incomes are lower, and savings are higher,"" says Gerard DiPippo, a senior researcher at the Rand think tank: ""Household incomes are lower, and savings are higher.""The Chinese government, however, has been slow to expand social benefits, focusing instead on boosting consumption through short-term measures, such as trade-in programs for household appliances and electronics.The property market matters not only for real economic activity but also for household sentiment, since Chinese households have invested so much of their wealth in their homes.""I don't think China's consumption will fully recover until it's clear that the property sector has bottomed out and therefore many households' primary assets are starting to recover.""",Positive
"'Oopsie, too late' - US courts tested by Trump's latest deportations Two recent incidents have ignited fears that the White House is willing to defy court orders",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c9wpek7p0kno,"– The Trump administration is pushing the bounds of executive authority, especially on immigration issues,"" said Elora Mukherjee, director of the Immigrants' Rights Clinic at Columbia Law School.""When the executive branch wilfully disregards clear and specific court orders, as the administration did with the [Venezuelan] deportation flights, the checks-and-balances system established by the US Constitution is at risk, and our constitutional democracy is threatened.""The nine-member US Supreme Court, with its conservative majority, including three justices appointed by Trump in his first term, could be poised as the ultimate arbiter of this act.""It's a judge that's putting himself in the position of the president of the United States, who was elected by close to 80 million votes,"" Trump said on Sunday in response to a federal judge's order to suspend his firing of thousands of federal workers.The federal judge involved in Saturday's ruling—Judge Boasberg—made his order after five Venezuelans in federal custody filed a lawsuit challenging their removal under an 18th century law that has not been used since World War Two.The Alien Enemies Act of 1798 allows the president sweeping powers to order the detention and deportation of natives or citizens of an ""enemy"" nation without following the usual processes. According to US officials, more than 130 of those on the Venezuelan deportation flights were also expelled under that law, a move seemingly crafted to move quickly and evade immediate judicial review. White House officials said it did not purposely ignore a court ruling.",Negative

Deadline looms for Homeland Security to release Harry's US visa records,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3w13w757lgo,"– A US court has ordered that Prince Harry's immigration files must be made public by the end of Tuesday. District Judge Carl Nichols ordered the release of the documents based on a freedom of information request by the Heritage Foundation, a conservative US think tank in Washington DC. The foundation alleges that the prince concealed his past use of drugs, which should have disqualified him from obtaining a US visa. In the book, published in January 2023, Prince Harry wrote that he first tried cocaine at the age of 17.""It wasn't much fun, and it didn't make me particularly happy, as it seemed to make everyone around me, but it did make me feel different, and that was the main goal,"" he added.He also wrote about using marijuana, saying ""cocaine didn't do anything for me"", but ""marijuana is different, that actually really did help me.""The Heritage Foundation alleges that Prince Harry lied about his use of drugs to US immigration authorities, which can lead to a lifetime ban from the United States. Prince Harry moved to the US with his wife Meghan in 2020 after stepping down as a working royal.It is not clear what visa he entered the country on, while the duchess is a US citizen.",Negative
