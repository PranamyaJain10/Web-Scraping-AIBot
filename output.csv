Bowen: Syria's rebel offensive is astonishing - but don't write off Assad The country's president has already shown he is prepared to go to brutal lengths to save his regime.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvgpdpgz4kdo,"– Russia has launched air strikes in the last few days against the rebel offensive in Syria—but its military power is almost entirely earmarked to fight the war in Ukraine.The war in Syria did not end. It dropped out of the place it used to occupy in headline news, partly because of turbulence across the Middle East and beyond, and because it is almost impossible for journalists to get into the country.The UN envoy to Syria, Geir Pedersen, issued a statement saying that ""the latest developments pose severe risks to civilians and have serious implications for regional and international peace.""The offensive led by HTS comes out of the splintered political landscape of northern Syria. Now a coalition of rebel groups, led by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), has broken out of Idlib, the province along the border with Turkey that it controls, and in only a few days since 27 November swept away Syrian troops in a series of ""astonishing"" events, as one senior international diplomat told me.

Why would a US fugitive choose to hide in Wales?

Peter believes it was most likely the purchase of this property that marked the start of the end of Mr San Diego's life on the run.""Maybe purchasing that property created the electronic footprint opportunity for the FBI to exploit, which therefore led to his capture,"" he said.",Positive
