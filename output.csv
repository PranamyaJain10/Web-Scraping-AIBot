Starbucks baristas had little choice but to yell out these names once the drinks were ready for collection.""Our goal is to make sure every customer has a great experience in our coffeehouses,"" Starbucks said in a statement about its new move to ban the six presidential candidates' names.""To help with that, we sometimes block certain phrases that could be misunderstood by our employees or customers—like names of political candidates with messages of support or opposition during election season to maintain neutrality.""But this marks the first time it has banned the names of all the candidates running in an election.",Positive

The loud hum sparking unrest in Trump's MAGA heartlands,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx2qg6e03l2o,"– ""It's an annoyance,"" says Ellen Campbell, who owns a house on Seneca Lake a short distance away. ""If I sit out by the lake, I would rather not hear that.""The issue here in Dresden, a village of about 300 people surrounded by winding country roads, single-track rail lines and farms growing grapes and hops, sounds like a familiar story about the tension between nature-loving locals and economic development.But their annoyance is also a signal of something less expected— policies of US President Donald Trump meeting resistance from people in the rural areas whose votes drove his return to the White House.And the cause? Bitcoin mining.An energy-intensive process that relies on powerful computers to create and protect the cryptocurrency, Bitcoin mining has grown rapidly in the country over recent years. Trump has said he wants to turn the US into the crypto-mining capital of the world, announcing in June 2024 that ""we want all the remaining Bitcoin to be made in the USA.""The conflict in Seneca Lake is being played out nationwide, which could pose problems for a White House intent on pursuing a pro-cryptocurrency agenda.A little over 300 miles west of Dresden, a backlash in the US border town of Niagara Falls prompted the local Mayor Robert Restaino - a Democrat - to issue a moratorium on new mining activity in December and the following year noise limits of 40 to 50 decibels near residential areas were imposed.",Positive
