In those freezing days, in bitter wind and flurries of snow, it felt as if the colours of the 21st century were fading into an old monochrome newsreel that Europeans had believed until then was safely consigned to the vaults of history.President Zelensky, in Joe Biden's words, ""didn't want to hear"" American warnings that an invasion was imminent.Instead, Donald Trump has delivered a stream of exaggeration, half-truths and outright lies about the war that echo the views of President Putin.In the weeks after Vladimir Putin ordered the full-scale invasion of Ukraine, the sound of battle on the edge of Kyiv echoed around streets that were almost empty.Trump's negotiating strategy is to offer concessions even before serious talks have started.Instead, his public statements have offered Russia important concessions, declaring that Ukraine will not join NATO and accepting that it will keep at least some of the land it seized by force.In those freezing days, in bitter wind and flurries of snow, it felt as if the colours of the 21st century were fading into an old monochrome newsreel that Europeans had believed until then was safely consigned to the vaults of history.President Zelensky, in Joe Biden's words, ""didn't want to hear"" American warnings that an invasion was imminent.Trump's negotiating strategy is to offer concessions even before serious talks have started.Instead, he has turned on Ukraine.",Negative

Is the downfall of a Japanese star a turning point for women's rights?
