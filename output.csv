Left-leaning leader wins Sri Lanka election in political paradigm shift Anura Kumara Dissanayake beat his rivals after a historic second round of vote counting.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clyznjz3d78o,"– Left-leaning politician Anura Kumara Dissanayake has won Sri Lanka's presidential election after a historic second round of counting.No candidate won more than 50% of the total votes in the first round, where Dissanayake got 42.31% while his closest rival, opposition leader Sulasith Premadasa, got 32.76%.But Dissanayake, who promised voters good governance and tough anti-corruption measures, emerged as winner after the second count, which tallied voters' second and third choice candidates.The election on Saturday was the first to be held since mass protests unseated the country's leader, Gotabaya Rajapaksa, in 2022 after Sri Lanka suffered its worst economic crisis. Dissanayake, 55, told Sri Lankans ""this victory belongs to us all"", in a message on the social media platform X.Once preferences had been tallied, the Election Commission said he had won a total of 5,740,179 votes to Premadasa's 4,530,902.",Positive
Who is Sri Lanka’s new president Anura Kumara Dissanayake? The former Marxist is considered a disruptor to the old discredited political order.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c206l7pz5v1o,"– Left-leaning politician Anura Kumara Dissanayake has been elected as Sri Lanka's next president after he won the debt-ridden country's first election since its economy collapsed in 2022.The 55-year-old beat off his nearest rival, opposition leader Sajith Premadasa, to emerge as the clear winner after a historic second round of counting, which included second-preference votes. Outgoing president Ranil Wikremesinghe trailed in third.It's a remarkable turnaround for a man who won just 3% of the votes in the 2019 election. Dissanayake, who contested as candidate for the National People's Power ( NPP) alliance, has drawn increasing support in recent years for his anti-corruption platform and pro-poor policies—particularly in the wake of the country's worst ever economic crisis, which is still having an impact on millions. Dissanayake, who was elected to the JVP's central committee in 1997 and became its leader in 2008, has since apologized for the group's violence during this so-called ""season of terror"".""A lot of things happened during the armed conflict that should not have happened,"" he said in a 2014 interview with the BBC.""We are still shocked, and shocked that things happened at our hands that should not have happened.Politicians who promised to stop corruption have engaged in corruption; those who promised to create a debt-free Sri Lanka have only worsened the debt burden; people who promised to strengthen the law have broken it.""",Positive
Germany's chancellor Scholz escapes far-right win in home state - exit polls The chancellor's hopes of a second term are bolstered as his SPD is set to defeat the far right in Brandenburg.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c24315lrv18o,"– Germany's chancellor appears to have narrowly dodged humiliation after exit polls suggested his party has held off the far right in his home state.Olaf Scholz's center-left Social Democratic Party (SPD) won Sunday's regional election in stronghold Brandenburg by just one or two percentage points, according to polls by the two main public broadcasters.Alternative for Germany (AfD) stood a chance of winning the state, which has been governed by the SPD since German reunification in 1990.But after voting ended at 18:00 (16:00 GMT), predictions put the SPD on 31 to 32% to the AfD's 29 to 30%. The election, on the outskirts of Berlin, was being watched closely after the AfD became the first far-right party to win a state election in Germany since World War II, in the eastern state of Thuringia, on 1 September.An AfD win in Sunday's election would have dealt a major blow to Scholz's hopes of a second term in Germany's federal elections next year.It would also have been embarrassing, given he lives in the state's capital, Potsdam.Scholz has faced plummeting opinion polls and infighting in his embattled coalition government.",Positive
"Zelensky to present 'victory plan' to Biden, Harris and Trump Speaking as he headed to the US, the Ukrainian president says this autumn will determine the future of the war.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5y30244467o,"– Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky is set to present what he has called his ""plan for victory"" to President Joe Biden during a visit to the US this week.After meeting Biden, Zelensky said he intended to present it to Congress and the two candidates in the US election—Vice-President Kamala Harris and former president Donald Trump.Trump has previously criticized US support for Ukraine and spoken highly of Russian President Vladimir Putin but said he will ""probably"" meet Zelensky.The Ukrainian president's visit to the US—where he is also due to attend the UN General Assembly— coincides with efforts from the White House to prepare a new $375m military aid package for Ukraine.Zelensky said in a post on X alongside his nightly video address, which he delivered from his plane.In a statement ahead of the visit, the Ukrainian leader previewed three elements to this victory plan.He listed further weapons donations for the military, diplomatic efforts to force Russia into peace, and to hold Moscow accountable for the full-scale invasion of his country in 2022.Ukraine has been pleading for months for the US, UK and other Western allies to ease restrictions on the use of long-range missiles so it can strike targets in Russia which Kyiv says are used to launch attacks.Earlier in September, Putin warned Western countries that he would consider long-range missile strikes as ""direct participation"" by the NATO military alliance in the war.Trump has previously flagged his own plan to end the war ""within 24 hours"" if he is elected in November, but has provided no details other than to label US support for Ukraine as a waste of money.",Negative

Trump suggests he will not run again if he loses election For the second time in a week the Republican presidential candidate has acknowledged the prospect of defeat.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/czj9ekdvxx2o,"– Former President Donald Trump has said he does not expect to run for election again in 2028 if he is defeated in this November's US presidential poll. Trump, 78, has been the Republican candidate for three national elections in a row and has reshaped the party greatly over the last eight years. In an interview with Sinclair Media Group, he was asked if he could foresee another run in the event that he loses to Democratic Vice-President Kamala Harris. ""No, I don't. I think... that will be it,"" Trump said. ""I don't see that at all."" But he added that ""hopefully, we're going to be very successful."" US law bars presidents from serving more than two terms, and so Trump is not expected to run in 2028 if he wins, either. In the past, the real estate mogul has rarely acknowledged the possibility of losing the election, more often firing up supporters with speeches and social media posts pledging victory at the polls.But this is the second time in four days he has mentioned a chance of defeat. During an event held by the Israeli-American Council on Thursday, he brought up losing, and suggested that any such loss would partly be the fault of Jewish voters.",Negative
