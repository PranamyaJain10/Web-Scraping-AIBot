Trump reignites tensions with EU tariff threats EU says threats should not guide trade talks as Trump says he wants tariffs of 50% on European goods as soon as 1 June.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cgr5xrygzk5o,"– US President Donald Trump reignited trade tensions on Friday, threatening a 50% tariff on all goods sent to the United States from the European Union.He also warned Apple that he would impose a 25% import tax ""at least"" on iPhones not manufactured in America, later widening the threat to any smartphone.The warning against the EU came just hours before the two sides were set to have trade talks. Trump last month announced a 20% tariff on most EU goods, but had halved it to 10% until 8 July to allow time for negotiations.In a statement after the talks, the EU said it remained committed to securing a deal, while warning again that it was prepared to retaliate.The S&P 500 down about 0.7% and Germany's Dax and France's 40 ending the day down more than 1.5%.Trump said he did not intend to single out Apple but planned to apply the duties to all smart phones, which could start by the end of June.The EU is one of the US' largest trading partners, sending more than $600bn in goods to the US last year and buying about $370bn worth, according to US government figures.Trump's complaints about Europe have focused on that uneven trade relationship, as the EU sells more goods to the US than it buys from America.He targeted goods from the EU with a 20% tariff in his so-called Liberation Day announcement last month, which set off a flurry of negotiations between the US and countries around the world.",Positive

"San Diego airport experienced glitches before fatal plane crash All six on the plane are believed to be dead, including a former drummer for The Devil Wears Prada and a high-profile music agent.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c8rey5kvzy5o,"– Investigators are examining whether foggy conditions and technical glitches at a San Diego airport that cut off lights meant to guide pilots may have played a role in a fatal plane crash.A Cessna 550 crashed early Thursday into a residential neighborhood, burning cars and destroying at least one home. Authorities say all six aboard are presumed dead, including a former drummer for the rock band The Devil Wears Prada and a high-profile music agent.The National Transportation Safety Board is examining a mix of clues and said the aircraft did not have a flight data recorder, which would have provided more information.The airport also had filed a notice to pilots called a Notam, informing them that one of the runways had experienced an issue with the lighting system that guides landing planes.The pilot of the downed plane had been aiming for that runway when the crash occurred, Mr Baker said.Mr Baker attributed the outage to ""some sort of technical glitch"" but cautioned that it is unclear whether this contributed to the crash since not all airports are equipped with this system.The company had earlier confirmed the death of its co-founder, prominent music agent Dave Shapiro.Williams was a founding member of The Devil Wears Prada and part of the Christian metal band for more than 10 years before parting ways in 2016.",Negative
