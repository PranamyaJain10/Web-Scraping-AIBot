Putin agrees in Trump call to pause Ukraine energy attacks but no full ceasefire The Russian leader declines to sign up to a plan that Ukraine had accepted for a month-long ceasefire.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cd65pz1p7d9o,"– President Vladimir Putin has rejected an immediate and full ceasefire in Ukraine, agreeing only to halt attacks on energy infrastructure, following a call with US President Donald Trump.The Russian leader declined to sign up to the comprehensive month-long ceasefire that Trump's team recently worked out with Ukrainians in Saudi Arabia.He said a comprehensive truce could only work if foreign military aid and intelligence sharing with Ukraine came to an end.Ukraine's European allies have previously rejected such conditions.Trump posted earlier on social media that his call with the Russian leader was ""very good and productive"" and that ""many elements of a Contract for Peace were discussed"".""We agreed to an immediate Ceasefire on all Energy and Infrastructure, with an understanding that we will be working quickly to have a Complete Ceasefire and, ultimately, an END to this very horrible War between Russia and Ukraine,"" the US president said on Truth Social.The Kremlin's own statement on the call noted what it said were a ""series of significant issues"" around enforcing any agreement with Kyiv.Trump and Putin agreed to immediate technical-level talks towards a longer-term settlement, which the Kremlin said must be ""complex, stable and long-term in nature.""It's unclear if this means further negotiations between the US and Russia, or bilateral talks between Russia and Ukraine.Putin has previously insisted Russia should keep control of Ukrainian territory it has seized and has called for Western sanctions to be eased as part of any eventual peace settlement.",Positive
US astronauts Butch and Suni finally back on Earth after nine-month delay Dolphins circled their capsule after it landed off the coast of Florida.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0mw221z2yyo,"– After nine months in space, NASA astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams have finally arrived back on Earth.Their SpaceX capsule made a fast and fiery re-entry through the Earth's atmosphere, before four parachutes opened to take them to a gentle splashdown off the coast of Florida. A pod of dolphins circled the craft.After a recovery ship lifted it of the water, the astronauts beamed and waved as they were helped out of the hatch, along with fellow crew members astronaut Nick Hague and cosmonaut Aleksandr Gorbunov.The saga of Butch and Suni began in June 2024.They were taking part in the first crewed test flight of the Starliner spacecraft, developed by aerospace company Boeing.But the capsule suffered several technical problems during its journey to the space station, and it was deemed too risky to take the astronauts home.Starliner returned safely to Earth empty in early September, but it meant the pair needed a new ride for their return.So Nasa opted for the next scheduled flight: a SpaceX capsule that arrived at the ISS in late September.It flew with two astronauts instead of four, leaving two seats spare for Butch and Suni's return.The only catch was this had a planned six-month mission, extending the astronauts stay until now.The NASA pair embraced their longer-than-expected stay in space.",Negative

Federal judge halts further shuttering of USAID The ruling orders Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency to halt its termination of workers and programs.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cdx2pz1l11jo,"– A federal judge has blocked the Trump administration from taking any further steps to shut down the US Agency for International Development (USAID).In a ruling Tuesday, Judge Theodore Chuang said the efforts led by Trump ally Elon Musk's Department for Government Efficiency (Doge) to close the agency likely violated the US Constitution ""in multiple ways."" Chuang ordered Doge to restore access to USAID's computer and payment systems for employees, including those who were placed on leave.The judge also ruled that termination of USAID employees should stop, but did not order the reinstating of employees previously placed on leave. Administration officials have said that more than 80% of its activities have been halted.The ruling came in a case brought on behalf of 26 unnamed USAID employees who allege in court filings that Musk is following ""a predictable and reckless slash-and-burn pattern"" in dismantling US government departments.In a complaint filed on 13 February, lawyers for the employees argued that Musk's power is illegitimate—as he has not been officially nominated to a government post nor confirmed by the US Senate—and asked for Doge's activities to be halted and reversed. USAID was one of the first agencies targeted by Doge for cuts shortly after Trump re-entered the White House in January and ordered a 90-day freeze of all US foreign aid. Musk and Doge argued in court documents that Musk's role is advisory only.But Judge Chuang ruled that Musk and Doge exerted control over USAID and in doing so ""likely violated the United States Constitution in multiple ways, and that these actions harmed not only plaintiffs, but also the public interest.""It's unclear what effect the ruling will have on USAID operations.",Negative
"Missing American Sudiksha Konanki's family asks she be declared dead Police have been searching for the missing University of Pittsburgh student, who was on spring break in Punta Cana, for the past two weeks.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5y9vlq4dlzo,"– The family of a missing University of Pittsburgh student has asked the Dominican Republic's national police that she be declared dead. Sudi Konanki, 20, disappeared on spring break while in the Dominican Republic. The Dominican Republic's police confirmed to the BBC that they had received the request from Ms Konanki's family, but did not provide additional details. Police have been searching for her for the past two weeks. Investigators are considering whether she may have drowned, but have not ruled out foul play. Ms Konanki is a 20-year-old college student attending the University of Pittsburgh, where she studies biology and chemistry. The college junior traveled with a group of five female friends to a resort in Punta Cana on a spring break trip, according to the Loudoun County Sheriff's Office. She is a citizen of India and a permanent resident of the United States. Surveillance video shows her and a group of friends walking toward the beach. Ms Konanki stayed on the beach with one of the men as the others returned to the hotel, Dominican police told the BBC's news partner CBS.Dominican President Luis Abinader said earlier this week during a news conference that the last person who had contact with Ms Konanki reported a wave hit them while they were on the beach. The parents of the man - Joshua Riibe - last seen with Ms Konanki released a statement to CBS News saying they hope Ms Konanki is ""found as soon as possible.""",Positive
"Netanyahu calls strikes on Gaza 'only the beginning' as hundreds reported killed Israel's PM warns ""this is only the beginning"" after deadly strikes on Gaza that broke a ceasefire with Hamas.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwyg28wd1k3o,"– Israel has ""resumed combat in full force"" against Hamas in the Gaza Strip, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Tuesday night.In a defiant video statement, he warned that ""negotiations will continue only under fire"" and that ""this is just the beginning.""His comments came after Israeli aircraft launched massive airstrikes against what the military said were Hamas targets in Gaza.More than 400 people have been killed in the attacks, the Hamas-run health ministry said, and hundreds more injured.The wave of strikes was the heaviest since a ceasefire began on 19 January.The fragile truce had mostly held until now, but this new wave of attacks suggests plans for a permanent end to the war may be off the table.Israel and Hamas have disagreed on how to take the ceasefire deal forward since the first phase expired in early March, after numerous exchanges of Israeli hostages and Palestinian prisoners.The deal involves three stages, and negotiations on the second stage were meant to have started six weeks ago—but this did not happen.Hamas warned the resumption of violence by Israel would ""impose a death sentence"" on the remaining living hostages held in Gaza, and accused Israel of trying to force it into a surrender.",Negative
"Analysis: Putin gives Trump just enough to claim progress on Ukraine peace Trump made a big deal of his conversation with Putin, but there is little to shout about, Sarah Rainsford writes.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwyg2kzkggvo,"– Donald Trump made a big deal of his conversation with Russia's Vladimir Putin.But the results look like there's little to shout about.The Russian president has given the US leader just enough to claim that he made progress towards peace in Ukraine, without making it look like he was played by the Kremlin.Trump can point to Putin's pledge to halt attacks on Ukraine's energy infrastructure for 30 days.But it's nowhere near the full and unconditional ceasefire that the US wanted from Russia.The ""very horrible war"" Trump has insisted he can stop is still raging.And Putin, a man indicted as a suspected war criminal by the ICC, has been given a leg-up back to the top tier of global politics.Russian state media report that the two presidents' phone call lasted more than two hours.The Kremlin readout—its account of the call—is also long at 500 words.It presents the conversation as chatty: they apparently discussed ice hockey, the kind of detail an audience back in Russia will lap up.",Negative
"Palestinian Columbia student activist speaks out about his arrest Mr Khalil warns that his arrest is part of a broader effort by the Trump administration to ""supress dissent"".",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cd65pp0pe03o,"– A Palestinian student activist, who was detained by US immigration officers earlier this month, has spoken out for the first time about his arrest.In a letter dictated over the phone to his family from an ICE detention facility in Louisiana, Mahmoud Khalil said he is a ""political prisoner"" and that he believes he was targeted for ""exercising my right to free speech.""Born in Syria, Mr Khalil is a green card holder and recent graduate of Columbia University.He also detailed his arrest, saying he and his wife were ""accosted"" on their way home from dinner by Department of Homeland Security agents ""who refused to provide a warrant.""Before I knew what was happening, agents handcuffed me and forced me into an unmarked car,"" he said, adding that he was not told anything for hours, including the cause for his arrest.Mr Khalil said he spent the night at 26 Federal Plaza, a federal office building in New York that includes an immigration court.Mr Khalil also took aim at Columbia University's leadership for its disciplining of pro-Palestinian students, saying that the school's actions laid the groundwork for students like him to be targeted.Mr Khalil's lawyers have argued that he was exercising free speech rights to demonstrate in support of Palestinians in Gaza and against US support for Israel.Mr Khalil said his story is a warning to others in the US, saying it is part of a broader strategy by the Trump administration to ""suppress dissent.""Visa-holders, green-card carriers, and citizens alike will all be targeted for their political beliefs,"" he warned.",Negative
Moment drink falls on man's lap leading to $50m settlement,https://www.bbc.com/news/videos/c2kg29p1g15o,"– A Los Angeles County jury has awarded $50m (£38.47m) in damages to Michael Garcia after a scalding hot tea from Starbucks caused severe burns. Garcia, a Postmates driver, suffered third-degree burns to his genital area when a loose cup fell into his lap at a drive-thru in February 2020. Starbucks was found 100% responsible for failing to secure the cup properly, which led to permanent disfigurement. The company plans to appeal the verdict, stating the damages are excessive.",Negative
"US and European armies should join our war on gangs, Ecuador president tells BBC",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c204290er1ro,"– Ecuador's President Daniel Noboa has told the BBC he wants US, European, and Brazilian armies to join his ""war"" against criminal gangs.He added he wants US President Donald Trump to designate Ecuadorean gangs as terrorist groups, as he has done for some Mexican and Venezuelan cartels.He also said Ecuadorean law would be respected when asked about his recent partnership with Erik Prince, an ally of Trump and founder of controversial private military firm Blackwater.President Noboa has previously indicated he would like foreign military aid to help tackle drug cartels—but this is the first time he has singled out the US, Brazil, and Europe.Security—and how he is dealing with it—is a top issue for voters ahead of a run-off vote in Ecuador's presidential election on 13 April.Noboa has defined his 16 months in office through a tough crackdown on gangs and militarising the streets and prisons—however he has also come under fire from critics who see his tactics as too heavy-handed.In an interview with BBC News, the incumbent president said: ""We need to have more soldiers to fight this war.""He said what started as 'criminal gangs' are now 'international narco-terrorist' groups of 14,000 armed individuals.Donald Trump's decision to designate some Latin American cartels as terrorist groups has given US law enforcement further powers to fight them.Noboa told the BBC he wants his US counterpart to do the same with Ecuadorean gangs: ""I would be glad if he considers Los Lobos, Los Choneros, Los Tiguerones, Los Tiguerones as terrorist groups because that's what they really are.""Noboa has already ordered the foreign ministry to seek cooperation agreements with ""allied nations to support Ecuador's police and army, and is also seeking parliamentary approval to change the constitution to allow foreign military bases in Ecuador again.",Negative
