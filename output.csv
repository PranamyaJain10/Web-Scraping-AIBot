Ukraine drones strike 40 bombers during major attack deep in Russia President Volodymyr Zelensky claims the operation is Ukraine's biggest long-range attack of the war so far.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1ld7ppre9vo,"– Ukraine says it completed its biggest long-range attack of the war with Russia on Sunday, after using smuggled drones to launch a series of major strikes on 40 Russian warplanes at four military bases.President Volodymyr Zelensky said 117 drones were used in the so-called ""Spider's Web"" operation by the SBU security service, striking ""34% of [Russia's] strategic cruise missile carriers.""SBU sources earlier told BBC News it took a year-and-a-half to organize the strikes, which involved drones hidden in wooden mobile cabins, with remotely operated roofs on trucks, brought near the airbases and then fired ""at the right time.""The most interesting thing - and we can already say this publicly - is that the 'office' of our operation on Russian territory was located right next to the FSB of Russia in one of their regions,"" the Ukrainian president said.The SBU estimated the damage to Russia's strategic aviation was worth about $7 billion, promising to unveil more details soon.The Ukrainian claims have not been independently verified.",Negative

Martial law fractured South Korea. Can this election heal the nation? The snap election follows the impeachment of former president Yoon for declaring martial law.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c7069pg4zpko,"– South Korea votes Thursday for its next president, and the Guardian takes a look at what's at stake: ""This is not South Korea politics as usual."" The country has been recovering from the martial law crisis last December, when the president, Yoon Suk Yeol, tried to orchestrate a military takeover. He failed, because of resistance from the public and politicians, and was impeached, triggering this snap election to choose his successor.But the chaos Yoon unleashed that night has festered.Most recent polls put Lee Jae-myung, the leading opposition candidate, about 10 points ahead of his rival Kim, but he was not always so popular.Lee has shifted his policies to the right, and even claimed his left-leaning party is, in fact, conservative.Lee has said he will change the constitution to make it more difficult for future presidents to declare martial law.""We must prevent the return of the rebellion forces,"" Lee urged voters at his recent rally from behind fortified glass.""I didn't like Lee before, but since martial law I now trust and depend on him,"" said 59-year-old Park Suh-jung, who admitted this was the first time she had attended a political event.""I don't like Kim but at this point there's no real choice.The other candidate has too many issues,"" said one elderly woman who is planning to vote for him.Kim has charted an unusual political path.As a student who campaigned for workers' rights, he was tortured and imprisoned under South Korea's right-wing dictatorship in the 1980s but then moved sharply to the right himself.He was picked by the party base, many of whom are still loyal to Yoon.This has left the party weak and divided, with many suspecting it will splinter into rival factions after voting day.",Negative
The fallout from Trump's war on Harvard will long outlast his presidency The US president's ramped-up threats are seen by many as an attempt to reshape a stronghold of the left. Could he succeed?,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0ln9lexyedo,"– Harvard's commencement ceremonies on Thursday, students said there was a ""palpable concern"" on campus.""People sort of knew Trump was trying some of these moves but [they were] shocked when it happens,"" admits one graduate, a British national who requested anonymity because he was concerned public comments could threaten his US work visa.But the repercussions of this apparent Harvard-Trump fight run far deeper than the management of a single Ivy League university.Trump's directives represent a frontal attack on one of America's most prestigious, and wealthy, institutions of higher education.Even if court challenges overrule some of these actions—some have already been put on hold—the impact is being felt across the landscape of American higher education.Trump and his administration have offered various explanations for their actions, including a perceived lack of conservatives among the ranks of Harvard's professors, along with suggestions of admitting too many foreign students and financial links to China.But according to the White House, the most immediate cause has been the university's apparent failure to address antisemitism on campus, in the wake of anti-Israel protests at universities across the US since the start of the Gaza war.",Negative
Ukraine's audacious drone attack sends critical message to Russia - and the West The BBC's Paul Adams reflects on the impact of Ukraine's major drone attack on Russian bombers.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0r1jv0rn0ko,"– It's hard to exaggerate the sheer audacity—or ingenuity—that went into Ukraine's countrywide assault on Russia's air force, but it's clear that ""Operation Spider's Web"" was, at the very least, a spectacular propaganda coup.Ukrainians are already comparing it with other notable military successes since Russia's full-scale invasion, including the sinking of the flagship of Russia's Black Sea fleet, the Moskva, and the bombing of the Kerch Bridge, both in 2022, as well as a missile attack on Sevastopol harbor the following year.Judging by details leaked to the media by Ukraine's military intelligence, the SBU, the latest operation is the most elaborate achievement so far.In an operation said to have taken 18 months to prepare, scores of small drones were smuggled into Russia, stored in special compartments aboard freight trucks, driven to at least four separate locations, thousands of miles apart, and launched remotely towards nearby airbases.The loss of the supersonic Tu-160, he said, would be especially keenly felt.Beyond the physical damage, which may or may not be as great as analysts here are assessing, Operation Spider's Web sends another critical message, not just to Russia but also to Ukraine's western allies.The biggest problem,"" the official told Svyatoslav Khomenko, ""is that the Americans have convinced themselves we've already lost the war.And from that assumption everything else follows.""",Negative
Red Cross says at least 21 killed and dozens shot in Gaza aid incident Reports say an incident occurred in Rafah in the early hours of Sunday as people were queueing for aid.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c991j01lym3o,"– The Hamas-run civil defense agency in Gaza said at least 31 people were killed and many more wounded in the incident, which it blamed on ""Israeli gunfire"" targeting civilians.But the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said findings from an initial inquiry showed its forces had not fired at people while they were near or within the aid center.All patients said they had been trying to reach an aid distribution site.The ICRC said it was the ""highest number of weapon-wounded in a single incident since the establishment of the field hospital over a year ago"", and that it ""far surpassed"" the capacity of the 60-bed facility.The group that runs the aid distribution center, the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), also denied the claims of injuries and casualties at its site and said they had been spread by Hamas.The IDF said in a statement: ""In recent hours, false reports have been spread, including serious allegations against the IDF regarding fire toward Gazan residents in the area of the humanitarian aid distribution site in the Gaza Strip.""Findings from an initial inquiry indicate that the IDF did not fire at civilians while they were near or within the humanitarian aid distribution site and that reports to this effect are false.MSF said at least two patients told them they and others had been shot while trying to get aid.",Negative
"Russia may attack Nato in next four years, German defence chief warns The Western alliance needs to prepare for a possible attack by 2029, Germany's top military officer tells the BBC.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c62v63gl8rvo,"– Members of the Western alliance NATO need to prepare for a possible attack from Russia within the next four years, according to Germany's chief of defense.General Carsten Breuer told the BBC that Russia was producing hundreds of tanks a year, many of which could be used for an attack on Nato Baltic state members by 2029 or even earlier.He also insisted that Nato, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, remains unified over the war in Ukraine, despite differences of opinion expressed recently by both Hungary and Slovakia.Russia also produced four million rounds of 152mm artillery munition in 2024, and not all of it was going to Ukraine either, added Gen Breuer.He cited recent attacks on undersea cables in the Baltic Sea, cyber attacks on European public transport, and unidentified drones spotted over German power stations and other infrastructure.Gen Breuer said this showed the differing perspectives among European states of the threat of a possible Russian attack.Russia's view of the Ukraine war was different from the West's, he said, where Moscow sees the war as more of a ""continuum"" in a larger conflict with Nato and is therefore ""trying to find ways into our defense lines and it's testing it.""Not every single tank is going to [the war in] Ukraine, but it's also going in stocks and into new military structures always facing the West,"" he said.He pointed to Finland and Sweden's decisions to join Nato shortly after the Ukraine war began.",Negative
Blues legends got their start in this town - now it's inspired hit film Sinners,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy8nj2dm7keo,"– When Edna Nicole Luckett sings the Blues on the stage at Red's, her voice, deep and soulful, echoes against the walls.The juke joint in Clarksdale, Mississippi is one of the last of its kind in the region, a landmark for a bygone era of American music.""I was raised in Delta dirt, sunshine and flatland that goes on for miles and miles,"" she sings, as people nod their heads and stomp their feet to the beat.Mr Coogler, who also made Black Panther and Creed, said it was his Uncle James, a Mississippi native who loved Delta Blues, who helped inspire the film.Although the movie was ultimately filmed in Louisiana, he visited Clarksdale to do extensive research.""I never got to come here until working on this script,"" Mr Coogler told a crowd of 1,500 on Thursday.It blew my mind—I got to meet musicians, I got to meet community members.It really changed me just to come here and do the research.""Mr Coogler, who also made Black Panther and Creed, said it was his Uncle James, a Mississippi native who loved Delta Blues, who helped inspire the film.Mr Miller wants people to have a better understanding of the history that lives on the streets on Clarksdale and the movie is a way to grasp that.""The movie itself is going to be great for the town - we get nine times the population of our city that comes to visit the city every year, now it could be ten or 11 times the population that visits Clarksdale,"" Mr Miller said.Mr Miller said.Mr Coogler's film fuses vampire lore with meticulous historic research about that time and place in America.",Positive
"Polish presidential election too close to call, exit polls suggest",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx27897vedno,"– A second exit poll in Poland's presidential election has indicated that conservative historian Karol Nawrocki is ahead with 50.7% of the vote over Warsaw's liberal mayor, Rafal Trzaskowski with 49.3%. The second exit poll sensationally overturned the result of an exit poll published immediately after voting ended that put Trzaskowski ahead with a narrow lead of 50.3% to Nawrocki's 49.7%.Trzaskowski had already claimed victory after the first exit poll indicated he was the winner.The current conservative incumbent president, Andrzej Duda, has used his powers to prevent Prime Minister Tusk delivering key campaign promises including removing political influence from the judiciary and liberalizing the country's strict abortion law.Nawrocki, 42, supports a strong sovereign Poland and does not want the country to cede any more powers to Brussels.He's a conservative Catholic that prioritises traditional family values.A keen amateur boxer and footballer, he often posted images of himself working out, allowing PiS to present him as a strong candidate who would stand up for ordinary Poles and the country's national interests.Poland's president is a largely ceremonial role with limited influence on foreign policy and defense, but they can veto legislation and Donald Tusk's pro-EU coalition government lacks a big enough parliamentary majority to overturn it.The current conservative incumbent president, Andrzej Duda, has used his powers to prevent Prime Minister Tusk delivering key campaign promises including removing political influence from the judiciary and liberalizing the country's strict abortion law.Nawrocki was accused of taking advantage of a vulnerable senior citizen to acquire his council flat at a huge discount in exchange for promises of care that were unfulfilled.He's the son of a famous Polish jazz pianist, speaks several languages and is viewed by some voters as a member of the country's liberal elite who is out of touch with ordinary Poles.",Positive
