JD Vance attacks Europe over free speech and migration The vice-president's speech at the Munich Security Conference was denounced by several European leaders.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ceve3wl21x1o,"– US Vice-President JD Vance has launched a scalding attack on European democracies, saying the greatest threat facing the continent was not from Russia and China, but ""from within.""It had been expected that Vance would use his speech at the Munich Security Conference to address possible talks to end the war in Ukraine. Instead, he spent the majority accusing European governments—including the UK's—of retreating from their values, and ignoring voter concerns on migration and free speech.The address was met by silence in the hall, and later denounced by several politicians at the conference.Vance repeated the Trump administration's line that Europe must ""step up in a big way to provide for its own defense.""The Ukraine war was mentioned, with Vance saying he hoped a ""reasonable settlement"" could be reached, after US President Donald Trump's surprise announcement earlier this week that he and Russia's Vladimir Putin had agreed to begin peace talks.But Vance's address otherwise focused on culture-war issues and key themes of Trump's campaign for the US presidency—a departure from the usual security and defense discussions at the annual conference.He alleged European Union ""commissars"" were suppressing free speech, blamed the continent for mass migration, and accused its leaders of retreating from ""some of its most fundamental values.""The EU's foreign policy chief, Kaja Kallas, characterised Vance as ""trying to pick a fight"" with Europe, home to some of the US's closest allies.Michael McFaul, the former US ambassador to Russia, told Politico Vance's remarks were ""insulting"" and ""just empirically not true.""",Positive
"Gaza plans put Egypt-US relations to tough test After decades of close ties, what happens to Gaza could put Egypt-US friendship at risk.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy4m3wx9w04o,"– With President Trump's surprise post-war vision, which proposes displacing two million Palestinians to ""a parcel of land"" in Egypt and Jordan, so that the US can take over the territory—they fear an existential threat.Egyptians flocking to Friday prayers say Trump's idea needs a reality check.The former US Secretary of State Antony Blinken envisaged world powers and the UN playing a temporary role in Gaza, until the Palestinian Authority (PA), which governs parts of the occupied West Bank, could take charge.But the Israeli Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, sought to block the PA's involvement, as part of devising a $20bn (£16bn; 19bn euros) proposal for building 200,000 homes in Gaza in just three years, without Palestinians being moved away.The plan is feasible, says Professor Mustafa Kamel al-Sayyid of Cairo University: ""I don't think it will be impossible for the Egyptians to find safe areas for Palestinians to move there while their part of Gaza is being rebuilt.""Various 'innovative ideas' are being put forward, he adds, including one for rubble to be used as a building material in reconstruction.Speaking ahead of a Middle East trip, the US Secretary of State Marco Rubio acknowledged that Arab states ""don't like"" the Trump Gaza plan.Some Arab leaders are due to meet soon in Saudi Arabia, with Egypt calling for an Arab summit to discuss an alternative ""comprehensive vision"" for Gaza in Cairo on 27 February.",Positive

Ralph Yarl, 16, rang Lester's doorbell as he went to pick up his younger brothers. Police initially said there was a ""racial component"" to the shooting, but authorities ultimately opted not to charge Lester with a hate crime.Lester and his lawyers said that he was acting in self-defense and thought the teenager was trying to break into his home. Ralph Yarl told authorities that his mother sent him to pick up his siblings around 22:00 local time that night.He mixed up similar street names - Northeast 115 Street and Northeast 115th Terrace - which put him on Lester's doorstep and about a block away from the house he was trying to visit.The case was also one of several in the spring of 2023 in which Americans - many of them children and teens - were injured after minor mistakes were met with gun violence.Police initially detained Lester for questioning and released him without charges, sparking protests in Kansas City. Ralph Yarl, who has since graduated from high school, is expected to deliver a victim impact statement at a sentencing hearing next month.The protests, which drew support from celebrities including Halle Berry, Kerry Washington and Jennifer Hudson, called for racial justice and drew attention to stand your ground laws.""We remain hopeful that his sentencing will not be merely a slap on the wrist but a decision that upholds the seriousness of his crime,"" the Yarl family said in a statement to local media.",Negative
"DR Congo M23 rebels enter city of Bukavu The Rwandan-backed rebels' entry into Bukavu follows their capture of Goma, defying international calls for a ceasefire.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvgmj00zjrpo,"– M23 rebels in the eastern Democratic Republic of Congo have entered Bukavu, the eastern region's second-largest city.Corneille Nangaa, leader of the Congo River Alliance which includes M23 rebels, told Reuters news agency the rebels had entered the South Kivu provincial capital on Friday evening and would continue their advance on Saturday.The Rwandan-backed militants' progress comes despite international calls for a ceasefire and a resumption of peace talks.Hundreds of thousands of people have been forced from their homes in recent weeks as a result of the rebel advance.Last month, the Tutsi-led M23, which is backed by neighboring Rwanda, seized Goma, the main city in the mineral-rich east. The Congolese government accuses Rwanda of sowing chaos in the region in order to benefit from its resources, a claim Rwanda has denied.The M23 briefly captured Goma in a previous conflict in 2012, but the taking of Bukavu, which is the capital of South Kivu province, would represent a new phase in the turbulent recent history of the region.The city, which borders Rwanda, is on the southern tip of Lake Kivu and is an important transit point for the local mineral trade.Earlier on Friday, rebel fighters had entered the airport some 19 miles north of Bukavu, as the Congolese army and a militia allied with it withdrew without putting up much resistance.But there were heavy clashes on the outskirts of Bukavu, South Kivu's Deputy governor Jean Elekano, had told the BBC.",Negative
Prosecutors ask to drop corruption case against NYC Mayor Eric Adams An order to halt the pursuit of bribery and fraud charges against Adams prompted the resignation of seven career US attorneys.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn93rnnjw4zo,"– The Department of Justice has filed a motion to dismiss its corruption case against New York City Mayor Eric Adams, the latest move in a row between the Trump administration and career US attorneys.The motion to dismiss the case, signed by Bove and two justice department lawyers, said that pursuing the case ""would interfere with the defendant's ability to govern in New York City, which poses unacceptable threats to public safety, national security, and related federal immigration initiatives and policies.""But several Department of Justice employees, including the top prosecutor in Manhattan, Danielle Sassoon, viewed the order to drop the case as politically motivated interference in the independent judicial system.The latest prosecutor to resign in protest at being ordered to drop the charges, Hagan Scotten, wrote in his resignation letter on Friday that US laws and traditions do not allow for ""using prosecutorial power"" to influence elected officials.Adams was indicted last year for allegedly accepting gifts totalling more than $100,000 from Turkish citizens in exchange for favors.The governor of New York state, Kathy Hochul, has the power to remove Adams from office.While she has not said she would take such action, she also indicated she hasn't entirely ruled it out, telling MSNBC that she was ""consulting with other leaders in government at this time.""If no lawyer within earshot of the President is willing to give him that advice, then I expect you will eventually find someone who is enough of a fool, or enough of a coward, to file your motion,"" Scotten wrote in the letter addressed to Bove.",Negative
Is Trump right when he says the US faces unfair trade? He wants to hit back at countries that place import taxes on American goods that he thinks are too high.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cjw4epl1994o,"– President Trump has ordered his team to come up with plans to impose a new set of taxes—known as tariffs—on goods coming into the United States.
