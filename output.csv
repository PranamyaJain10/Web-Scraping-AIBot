"Analysis: UK prime minister's ad hoc alliance could still struggle to materialise After a summit of Ukraine's allies, the PM's coalition is still a somewhat nebulous undertaking.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clyzgr5xgv6o,"– The US and Ukraine have agreed to keep military aid flowing to Ukraine and tighten restrictions on the Russian economy to weaken Vladimir Putin's war machine, he said, would now move to an ""operational phase"", with military chiefs due to meet in the UK next Thursday.""Overall, we are successfully gathering political and military momentum,"" he said.It is likely that we will see a rolling set of political, diplomatic, and military gatherings as the plan slowly takes shape.It is far from plain sailing. Asked about vital US military support for any European-led operation—what's being called a ""backstop""—the prime minister was clear: the US position had not changed.European national security advisors including Jonathan Powell—one of those credited with convincing Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky to accept the US ceasefire proposal—were in Washington on Friday.Unless US President Donald Trump's position on the backstop changes, Sir Keir's coalition of the willing could struggle to get off the ground.Ukraine vehemently denies reports that its forces are surrounded in Kursk—a theory promoted by Trump on Friday—but they are clearly under enormous pressure and are losing ground.",Positive
Trump blocked from using wartime law for mass deportations A judge ordered a 14-day halt on deporting Venezuelans under a Trump order that declared them enemies.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c89yk405lg9o,"– A federal judge has blocked President Donald Trump from using a 227-year-old law meant to protect the US during wartime to carry out mass deportations of Venezuelans.Trump on Saturday declared immigrants belonging to the Venezuelan crime gang Tren de Aragua were ""conducting irregular warfare"" against the US and that he would deport them under the Alien Enemies Act of 1798.But US District Judge James Boasberg on Saturday evening ordered a halt to deportations covered by the proclamation that will last for 14 days, according to media reports.Judge Boasberg told a hearing he had heard planes with deportees were taking off and ordered them turned back.The law allows the US during wartime to detain and remove people threatening the country's safety without having to follow due process.It was last invoked to intern people of Japanese descent during World War Two.The proclamation, and the fight around it, should rally Trump's supporters, who largely returned him to the White House on his pledges to crack down on illegal immigration and bring down prices of everyday goods.Trump had promised to use the controversial law for mass deportations during last year's campaign.The American Civil Liberties Union and other rights group had already sued to block him from using it on Saturday before he issued the proclamation, as well.The ACLU lawyer had told the New York Times he believed there were two planes of Venezuelan immigrants in the air on Sunday.The case will now move through the legal system and could go all the way to the Supreme Court.",Negative

'I was duped into leaving London for school in Ghana - but it saved me',https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c2kg1ezyv5xo,"– When my mother told me at the age of 16 that we were going from the UK to Ghana for the summer holidays, I had no reason to doubt her.It was just a quick trip, a temporary break - nothing to worry about.Yet, speaking for myself, by the time I turned 21 I realized what my mother had done had been a blessing.I was hoodwinked in a similar way to the British-Ghanaian teenager who recently took his parents to the High Court in London for sending him to school in Ghana.My mother placed me in the care of her two closest brothers, they wanted to keep an eye on me and it was felt that being around boarders could prove too much of a distraction.I first stayed with my Uncle Fiifi, a former UN environmentalist, in a town called Dansoman, near the capital, Accra.The lifestyle change hit hard.In London, I had my own bedroom, access to washing machines and a sense of independence - even if I was using it recklessly.It was her vehicle that I would later steal - something of a watershed moment.I did not even know how to drive properly, treating a manual like an automatic and I crashed it into a high-ranking soldier's Mercedes.I tried to flee the scene.My mother placed me in the care of her two closest brothers, they wanted to keep an eye on me and it was felt that being around boarders could prove too much of a distraction.I first stayed with my Uncle Fiifi, a former UN environmentalist, in a town called Dansoman, near the capital, Accra.The lifestyle change hit hard.I used to love to learn words in my mother's Fante language - but was far from fluent.When I later moved to the city of Tema to stay with my favorite uncle, Uncle Jojo - an agricultural expert, I continued private tuition at Tema Secondary School.",Positive
Arlington Cemetery strips content on black and female veterans from website,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cz03gjnxe25o,"– Arlington National Cemetery has scrubbed from its website information and educational materials about the history of black and female service members.Some of the content unpublished from the site was on veterans who had received the nation's highest military recognition, the Medal of Honor, according to military news site Task & Purpose.The content removal is part of a larger effort by President Donald Trump to eliminate diversity, equity and inclusion practices in the military and throughout the federal government.Approximately 400,000 veterans are buried in the Army-run cemetery, which was established after the US Civil War at the home of the South's general, Robert E.
