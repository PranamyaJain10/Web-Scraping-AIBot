Maxwell is seeking a pardon from Trump and has been accused of lying to federal officials. Shortly after the interview with Blanche—who previously worked as Trump's personal attorney—she was moved from a Florida prison to a new minimum-security facility in Texas.

Man who alleged hundreds were raped and buried in Indian temple town arrested The former temple cleaner's startling claims threw the town of Dharmasthala in Karnataka into turmoil.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cgm2z9zjgx7o,"– Police in India have arrested a man who recently alleged that he had been coerced into burying hundred of bodies of women who were raped before being murdered.His startling claims had thrown the tiny religious town of Dharmasthala in the southern state of Karnataka into turmoil.Home to the centuries-old temple to Manjunatha Swamy—an incarnation of Shiva from the Hindu holy trinity—the town attracts thousands of pilgrims daily and is central to the fabric of local people's lives.A political row in the state resulted in the government setting up a Special Investigation Team (SIT) to verify the man's allegations.A SIT official who did not want to be named told the BBC on Saturday morning that the man ""has been arrested for perjury.""The allegations also resulted in a huge political row—the issue was discussed in the just-concluded session of the state assembly, with the opposition BJP members calling it a ""smear campaign"" against a Hindu religious site that has millions of devotees.Saturday's arrest comes as a major turn in a saga that has set off a firestorm within the state and outside.The man said he worked as a cleaner at the temple from 1995 to 2014—and alleged that he had been forced to bury the bodies of hundreds of girls and young women who were brutally raped and murdered.He narrated five alleged incidents where he gave specifics, and said there were many others.The cleaner did not name anyone but blamed the ""temple administration and its staff""— allegations the temple chief rejected as ""false and baseless.""The skull and skeletal remains he produced are not brought from any spot in which he claimed to have buried the bodies,"" the SIT official said.",Negative

"My trip to North Korea's 'Benidorm' - flanked by guards and full of rules Anastasia, one of the first Russian visitors to North Korea's new resort, tells of ""immaculate"" beaches, meaty meals and strict rules.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c707d1ez0kno,"– It was the security guards accompanying Anastasia Samsonova's group that suggested this wasn't a typical beach holiday.In July, the 33-year-old human resources worker was one of the first tourists to stay at a new holiday resort in North Korea, a country largely closed to the outside world.Set in an exclusive area on the east coast where leader Kim Jong Un spent much of his youth, the Wonsan Kalma Coastal Tourist Zone opened on 1 July.Built near a missile testing site, the resort features hotels, restaurants, shopping malls, and a water park, according to state media.But while it was initially billed as being open to international tourists, so far only Russians, entering in groups and organized by accredited travel agencies, have been allowed in. Anastasia says her group was also told not to photograph construction sites and was expected not to wear revealing clothes.She says the guides told her the guards were needed to ""prevent situations where we interacted with locals and startled them.""When we walked down the street, they [North Koreans] looked at us with great surprise because the country has been closed for a very long time,"" says Anastasia.Anastasia says no missiles were launched while she was there, but toy rockets were being sold nearby for $40.The travel agency which organized the first three trips to the resort, Vostok Intur, said there was high interest in potential tours in September, but North Korean authorities had yet to agree to them.Initially, tours were advertised online by Russian travel agencies for mid-September, but these were later removed.It is not just Russians who face difficulties getting to Wonsan Kalma, according to Andrei Lankov, an expert in China, an expert at Kookmin University in Seoul.He says Pyongyang deliberately limits the number of tourists and economic partner to only Russian citizens.Anastasia describes the resort as ""very raw"" and ""not the kind of vacation Russian tourists are used to.""But if you're tired of Asia, Turkey, Turkey, etc.Another tourist, and want something exotic—this is it,"" she added.",Positive

United Nations Command said about 30 North Korean troops crossed the heavily-fortified border between the north and south, Yonhap News Agency said.Pyongyang responded by accusing Seoul of a ""deliberate provocation.""Senior South Korean officials have raised concerns about North Korea receiving Russian missile technology in exchange for sending troops to back the Russian aggression against Ukraine.Whether the latest missiles fired by North Korea involved any Russian technology was unclear.",Negative
"Prison conduct, remorse and contraband: What we learned from Menendez parole hearings Phones, candles and behaviour by the long-term US inmates factored into the refusal of their release.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3ez2j3jzgjo,"– Lyle and Erik Menendez were denied parole after appearing before separate boards in California this week.The brothers have spent decades behind bars for killing their wealthy parents in 1989.Erik, now 54, attended his hearing on Thursday.Lyle, 57, appeared before a different panel on Friday.Both hearings were lengthy and held remotely.They revealed details about the pair's time in prison—some of which explain why the panels denied their release.In Erik's case, parole commissioner Robert Barton said the main reason for his denial was not the killings themselves, but Menendez's behavior in prison.Barton rejected the notion that he had been a ""model prisoner.""Erik was revealed to have stashed banned objects including ingredients for making wine and art materials—which he used to decorate his cell.Barton said Menendez's ""institutional misconduct showed a lack of self-awareness.""Asked why they killed their mother as well as their father, Erik said he ""saw them as one person"" after he learned that his mother was aware of the abuse.Lyle said it was his ""honest belief"" at the time that his parents ""were going to kill"" him.The brothers' aunt Teresita Menendez-Baralt, tearfully said she forgave the pair for killing her brother. Explaining that she had late-stage cancer, she spoke of her wish to welcome Erik into her home to ""wrap my arms around"" him before it was too late.Lyle's cousin Eileen Cano, who spoke at both hearings, told the board that she is amazed by how much Lyle had achieved despite facing life in prison.""While most people surrender to the crushing weight of prison life, Lyle rose above it,"" she said.""Lyle will not be a risk to the community because we as a family will hold him accountable,"" she continued.Barton acknowledged the support, but told Erik: ""Two things can be true.",Negative
National Guard in Washington DC to be armed amid crime crackdown,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cd7yperjxneo,"– ""DC was a hellhole,"" he said earlier on Friday, a day after visiting some of the deployed troops. ""But now it's safe."" National Guard troops ""will soon be on mission with their service-issued weapons, consistent with their mission and training."" It is unclear if the decision to arm the troops will mean that their mission in Washington is changing. So far, troops have not taken part in law enforcement operations—which have been carried out by local police and officers from various federal agencies—and have instead been posted near local landmarks including the National Mall and Union Station, the capital's primary passenger rail transportation hub. Trump ordered troops to Washington earlier in August and took control of its police force to combat what he described as ""out of control"" crime in the city. Just last week, the Pentagon and US Army said that troops involved in the deployment—which now number approximately 2,000—would not carry weapons. Trump said that the mission has brought ""total safety"" to Washington—and that the mission could be expanded to Chicago, another Democratic-run city whose leadership has sometimes found itself at odds with the Trump administration.",Negative
Trump's plan for DC homeless is giving San Francisco deja vu,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c2kz4d0vwlzo,"– President Trump—who has mocked the city for its problems—is taking a page out of San Francisco's playbook.Starting last week, federal agents have been clearing out homeless encampments in the nation's capital, making Washington DC the latest city to levy penalties on people for sleeping rough.The move to criminalize homeless camping began last summer, following a landmark US Supreme Court ruling that found it was constitutional to issue citations to homeless people and arrest them, even in the absence of shelter.Soon, cities and counties across the country were issuing citations.In California, Governor Gavin Newsom—a frequent Trump foil and former San Francisco mayor—quick made clearing encampments a priority, paving the way for San Francisco's dramatic transformation.But while local businesses and some residents say this has helped remove a blight on what's considered one of the country's most beautiful cities, others question how effective it has really been in solving the issue. Homelessness, and specifically tent encampments, had become an increasingly polarising issue in many cities across the country during the pandemic—but especially in San Francisco.Struggles with mental health and addiction have long landed people on the city's streets.The number of people experiencing homelessness has continued to rise, with at least 8,300 people experiencing homelessness in January 2024, a 7% increase from 2022.",Positive
