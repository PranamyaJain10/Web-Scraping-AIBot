Israel's cabinet approves Gaza ceasefire and hostage release deal The vote paves the way for exchanges of Israeli hostages for Palestinian prisoners to begin on Sunday.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvg44dkz551o,"– Israel's government has approved the new Gaza ceasefire and hostage release deal with Hamas, paving the way for it to take effect on Sunday.The decision came after hours of discussions that continued late into the night.The security cabinet earlier recommended ratifying the agreement, saying it ""supports the achievement of the objectives of the war"", according to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office.It came hours after the prime minister's office and Hamas both said they had finalised the details of the agreement, two days after it was announced by mediators Qatar, the US and Egypt. Under the deal, 33 Israeli hostages still held by Hamas in Gaza after 15 months of conflict will be exchanged for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails during the first phase lasting six weeks.Israel says three hostages are expected to be released on the first day of the ceasefire, with more small groups freed at regular intervals over the next six weeks.The Israeli military launched a campaign to destroy Hamas - which is proscribed as a terrorist organization by Israel, the US and others - in response to an unprecedented cross-border attack on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 taken hostage.More than 46,870 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.",Negative

"Decoding Donald Trump's new official portrait Photographers describe the photo as ""serious"", ""ominous"" and a ""message picture"".",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy4mmrr7j8mo,"– Many on social media compared the photo to Donald Trump's'mug shot', taken in Fulton County Jail in Georgia after he was charged with attempting to overturn his 2020 election loss—a charge Trump denies.The photo appeared to use ""monster"" lighting, he added, to dramatically illuminate the president-elect from below and make his eyes pop.The lighting setup gives the image an ""ominous"" look often seen in horror films, said Eliska Sky, a portrait photographer with the London Institute of Photography.The style of Trump's new portrait is a departure from the look of his 2017 image, and that of past presidents, including George W Bush.""You definitely make photos to please the client, and in this case, I think this is the type of image they wanted to portray,"" former White House photographer Eric Draper told the BBC.He recalled sitting down with then-President Bush and first lady Laura Bush to pore over a selection of images before they picked their favorite.""The idea was to have it look like nice, pleasant lighting, have it look like a professional portrait, with a nice expression because these photos are going to be welcoming people as they walk into their post office,"" he said.Andrew Parsons is a political photographer who worked for four British prime ministers from David Cameron to Liz Truss, as well as Boris Johnson for 13 years.It's not like a candid laugh, it's a stern, hard, look straight down the barrel of the lens.""It's a message picture, I'm delivering you a message,"" he said of Trump's photo.",Positive
"TikTok ban will be first test for Trump as dealmaker-in-chief The new law will land in the incoming president's lap – but it's also a political opportunity, writes Anthony Zurcher.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5y66q87lz2o,"– The Supreme Court did not give TikTok a last-minute stay of execution. If the popular social media site is going to continue to operate in the US, it will have to be politicians or businessmen, not judges, who save it.Shortly after the top court's ruling, President-elect Donald Trump posted on Truth Social saying he would review the situation, but everyone must respect the Supreme Court decision.""My decision on TikTok will be made in the not too distant future, but I must have time to review the situation. Stay tuned!"" Trump's legal team already had weighed in during the Supreme Court's consideration of this case, asking the justices to delay a decision to give him time to find a solution.""President Trump alone possesses the consummate dealmaking expertise, the electoral mandate, and the political will to negotiate a resolution to save the platform,"" the brief read.It firmly establishes that the constitutional protections of free speech contained in the First Amendment to the US Constitution do not save TikTok.In fact, the justices found that the TikTok ban, which Congress justified on the basis of protecting national security by preventing an adversary from collecting troves of data on tens of millions of American users, had a lower bar to clear than laws that directly regulate speech content.The court sidestepped other tricky issues—such as whether concerns about Chinese influence on TikTok's algorithm justified a ban.Trump also spent the past year campaigning for the support of social media influencers—and their youthful followers—many of whom are TikTok devotees.If the incoming president can ultimately find a way to satisfy national security concerns while keeping TikTok up and running in the US, it would provide him with an opportunity to post an early political win in his second term and be celebrated by TikTok's loyal users.",Positive
Creators mourn app where 'overnight' success is possible TikTok creators tell the BBC they will start to diversify where they post their content and lean in to other platforms.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cdd99r0jm3jo,"– TikTok is the most powerful social media platform to educate her 11 million followers about her life's passion: bees. The loss of the platform in the US—made more likely after the Supreme Court upheld a ban that is set to be enacted next week—will be ""substantive"" financially for Ms Thompson, a Texas beekeeper, but it is also a loss of an educational tool.""There are a lot of other people on the platform offering educational content or informative content,"" she told the BBC.Some 170 million Americans use the app and website.Unless its China-based parent company ByteDance sells the platform or intervention comes from the executive branch, the platform is set to go dark in the US on Sunday.The fate of the social media giant was left in the hands of the US Supreme Court after both Democratic and Republican lawmakers voted to ban the video-sharing app last year, over concerns about its links to the Chinese government and worries about the app being a national security risk.TikTok has repeatedly stated it does not share information with Beijing.But users and content creators say the social media platform has grown to become a fixture in society—and has helped regular users capture the limelight with millions of followers.I rarely hear of people going viral on Instagram or someone being an Instagram sensation but those are words you hear frequently on TikTok,"" Ms Thompson said.",Negative
