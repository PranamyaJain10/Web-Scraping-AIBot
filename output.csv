"Second child dies of measles as Texas outbreak worsens Health Secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr is reportedly headed to the state, which has recorded 480 cases.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckg2xyyj9w5o,"– A second child has died from measles as an outbreak of the highly contagious virus continues to grow in western Texas. The school-aged child was not vaccinated, had no underlying health conditions, and was in hospital suffering complications from measles, Aaron Davis, the vice-president of UMC Health System, told the BBC. US Health Secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr, who has faced a backlash over his handling of the outbreak, visited Texas on Sunday in the wake of the death, which is the third overall in recent weeks. The southern US state has reported more than 480 cases of measles so far this year as of Friday, a jump from 420 earlier in the week. Kennedy said he was deploying a team—as he did in March—to help distribute vaccines, medications, and other supplies, among other support services. The recent outbreak originated in a religious community that strongly rejects vaccines. In February, an unvaccinated six-year-old girl in the local Mennonite community was the first child to die of measles in the US in a decade. Kennedy, a vaccine sceptic, initially described the situation as ""not unusual"" but stopped short of recommending that parents vaccinate their children.
