In 2019, he was arrested with three other men in Maryland and detained by federal immigration authorities.But an immigration judge granted him protection from deportation on the grounds that he might be at risk of persecution from local gangs in his home countryWhat is the 1798 law that Trump used to deport migrants?What we know about Kilmar Abrego Garcia and MS-13 allegationsOn 15 March, he was deported amid an immigration crackdown by the Trump administration, after Trump invoked the Alien Enemies Act, a war-time law that allows presidents to detain or deport the natives and citizens of an enemy country.Mr brego Garca was taken to a jail in El Salvador alongside more than 250 other deportees.",Negative
From Miami to Mumbai - cities around the world are sinking at ‘worrying speed’,https://www.bbc.com/news/resources/idt-14d00552-9211-4dab-89d1-60e34e226e43,"– ""A lot of the sinking cities are in Asia or South-East Asia,"" says Ms Tay. ""That is likely because the demand for water is much higher there with very fast-growing populations and a lot of development.... This means that flooding will be more frequent, intense, and prolonged in the future."" A study by Nanyang Technological University in Singapore found that 48 coastal cities in Asia, Africa, Europe, and the Americas are sinking at a worrying speed, according to a study by Nanyang Technological University in Singapore. Based on the study and population data from the United Nations, the BBC estimates that nearly 76 million people live in parts of these cities that subsided, on average, at least 1cm per year between 2014 and 2020. ""A lot of the sinking cities are in Asia or South-East Asia,"" says Ms Tay. Some types of ground are affected more than others and Ms Tay believes the risks are especially acute for the many coastal cities built on low-lying deltas—where rivers divide before flowing into the sea.",Negative
