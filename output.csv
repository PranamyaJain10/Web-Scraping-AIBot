"Jeremy Bowen: Netanyahu's plan for Gaza risks dividing Israel, killing Palestinians and horrifying world The offensive to take and hold territory will sharpen everything that makes this war so controversial, writes the BBC's International Editor.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cd020j97l79o,"– Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has told Israelis that ""we are on the eve of an intense entry into Gaza."" Israel would, he said, capture territory and hold it: ""They will not enter and come out."" The new offensive is calculated, according to the spokesperson for the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) Brigadier-General Effie Defrin, to bring back the remaining hostages. The offensive will not start, Israel says, until after Donald Trump's trip to Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Qatar next week. Assuming Trump does not dissuade Israel from going ahead, Israel will need a military and political miracle to pull off the results described by Brig-Gen Defrin. It is more likely that the offensive will sharpen everything that makes the Gaza war so controversial. The war, starting with the Hamas attacks of 7 October 2023, has taken the conflict between Palestinians and Israelis to a point as dangerous as any in its long history.",Negative
