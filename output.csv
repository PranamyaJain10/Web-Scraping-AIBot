Defendants face judgement for actions that led to beheading of French teacher Eight people accused of abetting the jihadist murder of Samuel Paty will learn their fate in a Paris court.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/czjdmjxvvvvo,"– Eight people accused of abetting the jihadist murder of French teacher Samuel Paty are to learn their fate after a six-week trial in a Paris court.They include the father of a schoolgirl whose lie about Paty's alleged discrimination against Muslims in the classroom set in chain the events leading to his beheading on a street in October 2020.Also on trial are a Muslim activist who led an online campaign against Paty, two boyhood friends of Chechen-born killer Abdoullakh Anzorov who allegedly helped him acquire weapons, and four radicalized men with whom he exchanged messages on social media.The trial has centered on legal arguments over whether people who in advance had no knowledge of the attack—or in some cases even of its perpetrator—could by their words nonetheless be guilty of ""terrorist association.""The court heard the first public testimony from the girl, Z. Chnina, now aged 17.

"Jeremy Bowen: Syria's new ruler is politically astute - but can he keep his promises? Ahmed al-Sharaa is intelligent, astute and reluctant to say what sort of country he wants.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cqx8zy8r8jro,"– When I left London almost two weeks ago after the rebel coalition captured Aleppo—a stunning victory dwarfed by what followed—I thought I would be reporting a shooting war.The group known as Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, or HTS, was sweeping all before it, but I assumed that the regime would fight, as it did not stop doing as it was losing ground in the years before the Russians intervened in 2015 to bomb Syrian towns and villages to rubble.Almost a decade later, it was clear that Bashar al-Assad's Russian, Iranian and Lebanese allies had other wars to think about.But while the regime struggled with unwilling conscripts, it could always find Syrians who were prepared to fight and die for it, even at the height of the war after 2011, when rebels controlled much of Damascus outside the city center and the road to Beirut.My instincts about the fighting spirit of Assad's depleted band of loyalists could not have been more wrong.)",Negative

Asked about the fall of the Assad regime in Syria, Putin insisted it was not a defeat for the Kremlin—which supported President Bashar al-Assad militarily for years—but he admitted the situation was ""complicated.""Putin appeared in front of a large blue screen emblazoned with a map of the Russian Federation, complete with annexed parts of Ukraine.He added that Russia was in talks with Syria's new rulers to retain two strategically important military bases on the Mediterranean coast and that Moscow would consider using them for humanitarian purposes.Putin also emphasised the capabilities of Russia's new intermediate-range ballistic missile, Oreshnik, which was used in a strike on Ukraine in November.When asked by the BBC's Russia editor Steve Rosenberg whether he felt the country was in a better state than where his predecessor, Boris Yeltsin, had left it 25 years ago, Putin said Russia had regained its ""sovereignty.""",Positive
Former N Korean soldiers tell BBC how troops fighting in Russia might fare Army defectors say units sent to fight against Ukraine will have high morale but won't be battle hardened.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c6238exzjpxo,"– North Korean soldiers accidentally firing on a Russian battalion, killing eight, have been sent into the mountains for days with a small amount of rice, and are told it is part of their survival training.""Given these troops have been trained to fight in the mountainous Korean Peninsula, the defectors question how well they will adapt to fighting on the flatlands and in the trenches of Kursk.But, he adds, Kim Jong Un has no alternative to sending special forces, as regular soldiers spend most of their time farming, building or chopping wood.""Kim Jong Un had to send men who could demonstrate at least a certain level of combat ability, to avoid damaging North Korea's reputation in Russia.""The soldiers are sent into the mountains for days with a small amount of rice, and are told it is part of their survival training.""It is difficult to know how much has changed in the decade since Haneul defected, given the scarcity of information from North Korea.But according to another soldier, Ryu Seonghyun, who defected in 2019, the first three years in the military are ""incredibly tough"", even for the special forces. Haneul says he fired only three bullets in a single live-fire training session.The closest he came to combat was when a hungry farmer stumbled into the DMZ looking for vegetables.",Negative

Amazon hit by 'strike' during holiday season scramble,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy8yrgezmp5o,"– One of America's most powerful labor unions is staging a protest against Amazon, aiming to put pressure on the tech giant as it rushes out packages in the final run-up to Christmas.The Teamsters union said Amazon delivery drivers at seven facilities in the US had walked off the job on Thursday, after the company refused to negotiate with the union about a labor contract.Teamsters members were demonstrating at ""hundreds"" of other Amazon locations, according to the union, which described it as the ""largest strike"" in US history involving the firm.The company, which employs roughly 800,000 people in its US delivery network, said its services would not be disrupted.It was not clear how many people were participating in Thursday's action, which was joined by members of the United Services Union (ver.di) in Germany. Overall, the group claims to represent ""nearly 10,000"" Amazon workers, after signing up thousands of people at about 10 locations across the country, many of them in the last few months.The union has demanded recognition from Amazon, accusing the company of illegally ignoring its duty to negotiate collectively over pay and working conditions.Most of the Teamsters' Amazon campaigns have involved drivers technically employed by third-party delivery firms that work with the tech giant.The company denies that it is on the hook as an employer in those cases, a question that is currently the subject of legal dispute. Labour officials have preliminarily sided with the union on the issue in at least one instance.Amazon employees at a major warehouse in Staten Island in New York have also agreed to affiliate with the Teamsters.Their warehouse holds the distinction as the only Amazon location in the US where a union victory has been formally ratified by labor officials.",Negative

Willis is expected to appeal against the ruling, which is seen as a major legal victory for Trump.The ruling reverses the trial judge's decision to allow Willis to stay on the case after it was revealed she had a romantic relationship with a prosecutor she had hired.Willis brought sweeping charges against Trump and more than a dozen co-defendants last year for an alleged scheme to overturn the Republican's election loss in the state to Joe Biden in 2020.The case Willis brought against Trump became marred in controversy earlier this year, when it was revealed she had a personal relationship with lead prosecutor Nathan Wade, whom she hired for the case.The court's decision does not dismiss the indictment against Trump and his co-defendants, meaning a new prosecutor will be assigned to the case against them.Willis, however, has filed notice that she will appeal to the Georgia Supreme Court, and the official who would appoint her replacement declined to comment on his next steps.""At this point, all avenues of appeal have not been exhausted,"" Pete Skandalakis, director of the Prosecuting Attorneys' Council of Georgia, told CBS News, the BBC's news partner.Trump is unlikely to face a trial until after his time in the White House, but some of his co-defendants could face trials sooner.The case Willis brought against Trump became marred in controversy earlier this year, when it was revealed she had a personal relationship with lead prosecutor Nathan Wade, whom she hired for the case.The court's decision does not dismiss the indictment against Trump and his co-defendants, meaning a new prosecutor will be assigned to the case against them.",Positive
