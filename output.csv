Texas sues New York doctor accused of posting abortion pills The case - the first of its kind - will test what happens when state abortion laws are at odds.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c745qegw3ldo,"– Texas has sued a New York doctor for allegedly prescribing abortion pills to a Dallas-area woman, launching the first known legal challenge of its kind, which will test what happens when two states' abortion laws conflict. Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton's lawsuit accuses Dr Margaret Daley Carpenter of New York of posting the medication to the 20-year-old woman.It is alleged she took the pills when she was nine-weeks pregnant, violating Texas's ban on nearly all abortions.But Dr Carpenter, who could not be reached for comment, may be protected by New York's so-called shield laws, which aim to legally safeguard doctors who provide abortion pills to patients in other states.The legislation means New York will not co-operate with any other state's effort to prosecute, or otherwise penalise a doctor for providing abortion pills, as long as the doctor complies with New York law.New York is one of eight Democratic-led states with shield laws. Abortion is legal in New York up until the point of foetal viability, around 24 weeks of pregnancy, and after that point with restrictions. Paxton's lawsuit says Dr Carpenter is not licensed as a physician in the state of Texas and was therefore ""unauthorised"" to prescribe the drugs, which were mifepristone and misoprostol.According to the legal action, the Dallas-area mother became pregnant in mid-May this year.""The mother did not have any life-threatening physical condition aggravated by, caused by, caused by, or arising from the pregnancy that placed her at risk of death or any serious risk of substantial impairment,"" says the lawsuit. According to the legal action, the woman who took the abortion pills experienced ""severe bleeding.""The mother did not have any long-term medical complications,"" says the lawsuit.",Negative
