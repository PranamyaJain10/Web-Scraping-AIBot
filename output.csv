Xi Jinping is worried about the economy - what do Chinese people think? Two new pieces of research offer a rare glimpse into how Chinese people feel about their future.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3e95lny0x9o,"– China's sputtering economy has its worried leaders pulling out all the stops. What is less clear is how the slowdown has affected ordinary Chinese people, whose expectations and frustrations are often heavily censored.But two new pieces of research offer some insight.The first, a survey of Chinese attitudes towards the economy, found that people were growing pessimistic and disillusioned about their prospects.The second is a record of protests, both physical and online, that noted a rise in incidents driven by economic grievances.The sample sizes varied, ranging between 3,000 and 7,500.In 2004, nearly 60% of the respondents said their families' economic situation had improved over the past five years—and just as many of them felt optimistic about the next five years.The figures jumped in 2009 and 2014—with 72.4% and 76.5% respectively saying things had improved, while 68.8% and 73% were hopeful about the future.However in 2023, only 38.8% felt life had got better for their families.The second is a record of protests, both physical and online, that noted a rise in incidents driven by economic grievances.The world's second-largest economy may miss its own growth target—5%—this year.",Positive
"'People are just scrambling' - North Carolina reels from devastating storm Residents describe how the storm ""destroyed everything in its path"" and wiped out entire communities in the state.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c8xe5x7v0jpo,"– President Joe Biden called the storm ""history-making.""Some of the most dire reports are coming from North Carolina, where the state's governor Roy Cooper said that communities had been ""wiped off the map"" and that dozens of rescue teams had been deployed.Buncombe County and the western corner of North Carolina endured some of the worst of Helene's wrath.The county includes Asheville, a city located in the Blue Ridge Mountains famed for its arts and music scene.As residents begin to pick up the pieces, their futures remain uncertain.Grayson Barnette, a lifelong resident who grew up in Lenoir, North Carolina, and now lives nearby, said a lot of the residents have spent their entire lives in these storm-ravaged communities.Some people are just poor and have lived in the same places for generations.""People are just scrambling to get any resources they can,"" he said.Mr Fitzsimmons said the county set up a website where people can inquire about missing persons.Mr Barnette feared that residents' deep ties to their communities may have led some to stay and weather the storm despite warnings.The apartment he shares with his fiancée sits high up on a hill and was safe from any serious damage.But on Saturday afternoon, by then without power or food, they decided to make their escape, taking rain-drenched roads out to north-east Georgia.Mr Barnette feared that residents' deep ties to their communities may have led some to stay and weather the storm despite warnings.",Negative

"US ports brace for shut down as dockworkers strike The strike is set to significantly disrupt trade, creating uncertainty ahead of the US election.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3vkdp3rx17o,"– A dockworkers' strike is set to shut down ports across much of the US indefinitely, threatening significant trade and economic disruption ahead of the presidential election and the busy holiday shopping season. Tens of thousands of members of the International Longshoremen's Association (ILA) are preparing to walk out on Tuesday at 14 major ports along the east and gulf coasts, halting container traffic from Maine to Texas.President Joe Biden has the power to suspend the strike for 80 days for further negotiations, but the White House has said he is not planning to act.The two sides are fighting over a six-year master contract that covers about 25,000 port workers employed in container and roll-on/roll-off operations, according to the US Maritime Alliance, known as USMX, which represents shipping firms, port associations and marine terminal operators.Talks have been stalled for months and the current contract between parties expires on Monday.Union boss Harold Daggett has called for significant pay increases for his members, while voicing concerns about threats from automation.The ports involved handle about 14% of agricultural exports shipped by sea and more than half of imports, including a significant share of trade in bananas and chocolate, according to the Farm Bureau.The US Chamber of Commerce business group has called on President Biden to take action.""This is really a trigger event, one that will see dominoes fall over the coming months,"" said Peter Sand, chief analyst at ocean freight analytics firm Xeneta, warning that the stand-off also has the potential push up wider shipping costs.""I don't think we will see immediate, significant economic impacts... but over the course of weeks, if the strike lasts that long, we can begin to see prices rise and for there to be some shortages in goods,"" said Seth Harris, a professor at Northeastern University and a former White House adviser on labor issues.",Negative
"UK to finish with coal power after 142 years The UK's last coal power station, Ratcliffe-on-Soar, is due to end operations on Monday.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5y35qz73n8o,"– The first coal-fired power station in the world, the Holborn Viaduct power station, was built in 1882 in London by the inventor Thomas Edison—bringing light to the streets of the capital.From that point through the first half of the century, coal provided pretty much all of the UK's electricity, powering homes and businesses.In the early 1990s, coal began to be forced out of the electricity mix by gas, but coal still remained a crucial component of the UK grid for the next two decades.In 2012, it still generated 39% of the UK's power.But the science around climate change was growing—it was clear that the world's greenhouse gas emissions needed to be reduced and as the dirtiest fossil fuel, coal was a major target.In 2008, the UK established its first legally binding climate targets and in 2015 the then-energy and climate change secretary, Amber Rudd, told the world the UK would be ending its use of coal power within the next decade.Lord Deben served in former prime minister Margaret Thatcher's government when many of the UK's coal mines were closed and thousands of workers lost their jobs.It is a very sad moment.""I think it's made a big difference, because you need someone to point to and say, 'There, they've done it.

"VP debates rarely matter - the Walz v Vance showdown is different In a tight US election race, every opportunity to generate positive attention and political momentum is precious.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c8j7pd8ey3xo,"– Tuesday night's vice-presidential debate will be a fascinating contrast between two men with very different styles and political beliefs and two campaigns with distinct strategies for winning the White House.Donald Trump announced his selection of Vance back in July, at the start of the Republican National Convention and just a day after his near-assassination. Democrat Tim Walz and Republican JD Vance will meet for their one and only vice-presidential debate on Tuesday night in New York City.While the stakes in these kind of running-mate face-offs are typically low—an undercard to the presidential main event—this one might be different.If Vance was a front-runner to be Trump's running-mate, Walz's path to the Democratic number-two spot was considerably more unlikely.Walz, the governor of Minnesota, was not a leading contender for the job, but his viral appearances on television, deriding Republicans as ""weird,"" and his ability to defend liberal policies in moderate-friendly language won Harris over.",Positive
"A Himalayan river may be making Everest taller River erosion at its base is helping push Mount Everest upwards, a new study says.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1wn827dedyo,"– Mount Everest is 15-50m taller than it would otherwise be because a river is eroding rock and soil at its base, helping push it upwards, according to a new study.Loss of landmass in the Arun river basin 75km (47 miles) away is causing the world's highest peak to rise by up to 2mm a year, University College London (UCL) researchers said.“It’s a bit like throwing a load of cargo off a ship,” study co-author Adam Smith told the BBC.The Arun river most likely gained the capacity to carve off an extraordinary amount of rocks and other materials after it captured another river or water system in Tibet.The UCL study says the Arun river most likely earned its real strength when it 'captured' another river or water body in Tibet 89,000 years ago, which in geological timescales is a recent event.A Chinese academic, Dr Xu Han of China University of Geosciences, was the lead author in the study during a scholarship visit at UCL.“The changing height of Mount Everest really highlights the dynamic nature of the Earth’s surface,” he said.“The interaction between the erosion of the Arun river and the upward pressure of the Earth’s mantle gives Mount Everest a boost, pushing it up higher than it would otherwise be.”",Positive
Oasis ditch dynamic ticket pricing for US gigs,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cj04y6y0316o,"– Oasis have announced they will ditch dynamic pricing for the American leg of their reunion tour, after it caused ""an unacceptable experience"" for UK fans.The system raises the price of concert tickets at times of high demand.When Oasis' UK dates went on sale, some fans were charged more than £350 for tickets with an initial face value of £150.The band faced significant backlash, and the UK's competition regulator launched an investigation into whether Ticketmaster breached consumer protection law.In a statement announcing dates in the US, Canada, and Mexico, the group's managers said they wanted to ""avoid a repeat of the issues"" faced by fans in the UK and Ireland.It is widely accepted that dynamic pricing remains a useful tool to combat ticket touting and keep prices for a significant proportion of fans lower than the market rate and thus more affordable,"" they wrote.""But, when unprecedented ticket demand (where the entire tour could be sold many times over at the moment tickets go on sale) is combined with technology that cannot cope with that demand, it becomes less effective and can lead to an unacceptable experience for fans.""Previously, Noel and Liam Gallagher said they had not been aware that dynamic pricing would be used for their UK stadium shows next summer.In a statement earlier this month, the band said: ""It needs to be made clear that Oasis leave decisions on ticketing and pricing entirely to their promoters and management.""",Positive
