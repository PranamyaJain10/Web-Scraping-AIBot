A pink powder is being used to fight California fires. It's getting everywhere The bright substance blanketing areas of Los Angeles County has long been used to stop wildfires from spreading.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c93lqng957jo,"– As crews battle devastating wildfires in southern California over the last week, images have since surfaced of the pink powder-like substance covering vehicles and driveways. Officials said thousands of gallons of the substance were dropped in the last week to stop the flames from spreading. But what exactly is in it, and how does it help fight the wildfires? The flame retardant is a product called Phos-Chek, which is sold by a company called Perimeter.It has been used to fight blazes in the US since 1963, and is the main long-term fire retardant used by the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection. According to the US Forest Service, retardants ""slow the rate of spread by cooling and coating fuels, depleting the fire of oxygen, and slowing the rate of fuel combustion as the retardant's inorganic salts change how fuels burn.""Its use has been controversial in the past over its potential effects on the environment.A lawsuit filed in 2022 by the Forest Service Employees for Environmental Ethics, an organization made up of current and former employees of the US Forest Service, accused the federal agency of violating the country's clean water laws by dumping chemical fire retardant from planes onto forests.The Forest Service also has a mandatory ban in place on dropping fire retardant in sensitive environmental areas, like waterways and habitats of endangered species.",Negative
