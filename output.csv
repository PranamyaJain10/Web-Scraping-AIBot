Archbishop Gallagher said even he had been stunned by the magnitude of the void he feels has been left by the Pope's death.He was very much the voice of the voiceless and was very aware that the vast majority of people are powerless and do not have their destiny in their hands.Archbishop Gallagher acknowledged what observers had long suspected, that the Pope would rather be surrounded by regular people, and particularly young people, rather than meet the ""great and the good.""One thing I always admired about him—though did not always agree with at first—was that he didn't run away from difficult things,"" said Archbishop Gallagher.Pope Francis' very first trip outside Rome was to meet migrants on the Italian island of Lampedusa.",Positive
