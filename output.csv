What's different to them?,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c6254qe9dqgo,"– ""I'm absolutely petrified that a potential leader of the country can raise $1bn (£770m) from donors."" That's one of the sentiments expressed by a voter born in Melbourne, Australia, and now lives in Houston, Texas. He was born in the Philippines and moved to the US almost 18 years ago. He is from Rwanda and became a US citizen in October, making this his first US election.

Then he got $3,000.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn01l2nzj1wo,"– Howard Feinstein wasn't expecting much when he submitted his information to a lawsuit against Juul Labs that accused the vaping company of misleading customers about the addictiveness and safety of their products. Then more than $3,000 (£2,320) hit his bank account. ""I thought it was fake at first,"" said the 55-year-old real estate agent, who lives in Washington state. The payment to Mr Feinstein this week was one of more than 800,000 that the company is making to former customers as a result of a more than $300m court settlement finally approved earlier this year.Administrators of the settlement, which involved Juul and tobacco giant Altria, which previously held a sizable stake in the company, started mailing checks late last week. More than 14 million people submitted claims to the court, of which only about 842,000 were officially validated. Ms Sharp said the court followed a careful process to winnow the claims, looking for duplicates, signs of fraud and proof of purchase. The lawsuit alleged two things: that Juul customers paid more for the product than they would have had they been provided with accurate information about its addictiveness and safety, and that the products were unlawfully marketed to minors.",Negative
