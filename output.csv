Israel plans to expand Golan settlements after fall of Assad Israel says the move is necessary following the takeover of neighbouring Syria by an Islamist-led rebel alliance.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cz6lgln128xo,"– Israel's government has approved a plan to encourage the expansion of settlements in the occupied Golan Heights.Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the move was necessary because a ""new front"" had opened up on Israel's border with Syria after the fall of the Assad regime to an Islamist-led rebel alliance.Netanyahu said he wanted to double the population of the Golan Heights, which Israel seized during the 1967 Six-Day War and is considered illegally occupied under international law.Israeli forces moved into a buffer zone separating the Golan Heights from Syria in the days following Assad's departure, saying the change of control in Damascus meant ceasefire arrangements had ""collapsed.""The prime minster [Netanyahu] said we are not interested in expanding the confrontation with Syria and we hope we will not need to fight against the new rebels that are presently taking over Syria. So why do we do precisely the opposite?"" he told the BBC World Service's Newshour program.He added: ""We have enough problems to deals with.""Netanyahu's announcement comes a day after Syria's new de-facto leader Ahmed al-Sharaa criticized Israel for its ongoing strikes on military targets in the country, which have reportedly targeted military facilities.The UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights has documented more than 450 Israeli air strikes in Syria since 8 December, including 75 since Saturday evening.Al-Sharaa said the strikes ""crossed red lines"" and risked escalating tensions in the region, though he said Syria was not seeking a conflict with any neighboring state.",Negative

"'We just need peace': BBC speaks to Syrians watching Israel's incursion As Israel unveils plans to expand its Golan Heights settlements, Syrians living nearby say they want an end to conflict.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cgm9w2ym39go,"– An hour's drive from Damascus, on a country road into the Syrian village of Hadar, we meet Israel's army.Two military vehicles and several soldiers in full combat gear man an impromptu checkpoint—a foreign authority in a country celebrating its freedom.The Israeli Foreign Ministry said its actions were necessary because of threats posed by jihadist groups operating along the ceasefire line with Syria, describing its military incursions there as ""limited and temporary."" Israel's Defense Minister, Israel Katz, said on Sunday that the ""immediate risks"" to Israel remained, and the recent developments in Syria had increased the threat, ""despite the moderate appearance that rebel leaders claim to present.""The village chief, Jawdat al-Tawil, pointed to the Golan Heights territory Israel occupied in 1967, clearly visible from Hadar's terraces.Many residents here have relatives still living there.A week after President Assad's regime fell, the sense of freedom here comes tinged with fatalism.Jawdat al-Tawil told me that alliances in the area were shifting, and that he was now talking to these groups about reaching a deal.Israel has since stepped up its military campaign, taking advantage of the political vacuum to extend its reach.The residents of Hadar belong mainly to the Druze community—a tight-knit, introverted group which splintered from mainstream Shia Islam centuries ago.When Israel occupied part of the Golan Heights in the 1967 war, and later unilaterally annexed it, some of the Druze there opted to remain and take Israeli citizenship.Al-Sharaa, the leader of the Syrian militia Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) that forced President Assad from power this month, has his family roots in the occupied Golan Heights.Some here on the Syrian-controlled side fear Israel's plan is to grab more territory for itself.",Negative

I was just sweating,"" James said, adding that he also ended up wetting his pants when some fighters hit him with their guns—and laughed.Ghana's National Commission on Civic Education, a government body which is spearheading a public campaign to prevent young people from joining the jihadists, told the BBC that it was aware of James' experience.James, who is in his 30s and follows a traditional African religion, said the insurgents later attempted to recruit him, enticing him with the allure of power by saying he could one day become the commander of a battalion.""The commander brought out a sack. It contained different weapons, AK-47, M16, and G3 [rifles],"" James added.He said he was lucky to be released about two weeks later after he begged for his freedom, claiming that he had a sick child at home and promising the camp commander that he would become his recruiting-sergeant in Ghana—a promise he says he never kept.Jihadists linked to both al-Qaeda and the Islamic State (IS) group operate in the region.",Positive
