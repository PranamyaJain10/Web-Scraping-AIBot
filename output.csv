Newsom v Trump holds promise and peril for California governor Democrat Gavin Newsom has not been afraid to square off against the president - but this confrontational strategy is not without political risk.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1ld3pzg2n2o,"– ""California may be first, but it clearly will not end here,"" he warned.Democracy is under assault before our eyes.""Newsom's speech was the latest salvo between the US president and the Democrat who heads America's most populous state.The clash between the two leaders presents a formidable challenge to the 57-year-old governor.But it also offers a political opportunity for a man whose term in office ends next year and has his own presidential ambitions.""This is unquestionably an opportunity for Gavin Newsom,"" said Darry Sragow, a long-time California Democratic strategist.He says that the more Newsom can outline a story of Trump against California—a state with whom the president has a very clear grudge—the better the chances for the governor to benefit.""Don't make this into a mano-a-mano shootout between two gunslingers on the streets of Laredo,"" he said.Trump has accused Newsom of being ""grossly incompetent"" and of failing to adequately respond as some of the Los Angeles protests turned violent.Newsom called the arrest threat a step toward authoritarianism and said Trump's deployment of military personnel to secure federal buildings and protect immigration officials had inflamed protests that had been isolated and controlled.""The rule of law has increasingly given way to the rule of Don,"" he said in his Tuesday night address.Newsom's press team has also been active on social media, comparing Trump to the evil Emperor Palpatine from the Star Wars films.",Negative
Video shows crowds in Gaza scale fence to rush for aid Palestinians can be seen climbing over fences and running to get humanitarian aid in the footage.,https://www.bbc.com/news/videos/c14k60lzv00o,"– Footage shared online shows hundreds of Palestinians climbing over a large mound of dirt—with some seen scaling a metal fence—as they rush to enter an aid site in Gaza run by the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF). Palestinians are first seen waiting behind a fence, before a voice, off-camera, with an American accent shouts instructions. People are then seen entering the site and running towards what is assumed to be aid. The GHF is a new, controversial group backed by the US and Israel that aims to bypass the UN as the main supplier of aid to Palestinians. The UN and other aid groups refuse to co-operate with the new system, saying it contravenes the humanitarian principles of neutrality, impartiality, and independence. The video was shared by Alon Lee-Green, an Israeli anti-war activist, who said he had obtained it from an employee of ""the American company in Gaza."" It was unclear if this referred to the GHF or one of the private security contractors that staff its aid sites. Green described the scene as ""apocalyptic"" in a post on X.",Positive
"Harvey Weinstein guilty of sexual assault after New York retrial The jury found him not guilty of an additional sexual assault charge, and have yet to return a verdict on a charge of rape.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn7z3gezdjro,"– Harvey Weinstein has been found guilty of sexual assault in New York, after his sex crimes conviction in the state was overturned last year. A panel of seven female and five male jurors deliberated for five days in the six-week trial before unanimously voting to convict the disgraced film mogul on one of three counts.The jury found him not guilty of an additional sexual assault charge, and has yet to return a verdict on a charge of rape.The conviction is in addition to a 16-year sentence that Weinstein has yet to serve after being convicted of sex crimes in Los Angeles. Weinstein's spokesperson said the trial was ""fair until we got to the jury deliberations"".""More than one juror had complained that other jurors had preconceived notions and are using their beliefs of Harvey's life as evidence of guilt,"" the spokesperson said.The three women testified for days about the sexual abuse they alleged they endured at the hands of Weinstein.All three said they met Weinstein when they were young and looking for work opportunities in the entertainment industry. Weinstein's attorneys attempted to chip away at the credibility of the women, showing warm messages some of the women exchanged with the film mogul after the alleged assaults.An appeals court overturned Weinstein's previous conviction for sex crimes in New York last April, finding the 73-year-old did not receive a fair trial in 2020 because a judge allowed testimony from women who made allegations against him beyond the charges at hand.Weinstein was then indicted on new sexual assault charges in the state in September.",Negative
Trump claims rare earths deal 'done' with China The world's two biggest economies have agreed in principle a framework for de-escalating trade tensions.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4gkmy26e2po,"– Talks aimed at cooling tensions between the US and China have ended in a ""deal"", according to US President Donald Trump.He said China had agreed to supply US companies with magnets and rare earth metals, while the US would walk back its threats to revoke visas of Chinese students.Our deal with China is done, subject to final approval from President Xi and me,"" Trump wrote on his media platform Truth Social.It followed two days of intense talks in London to resolve conflicts that had emerged since the two sides agreed a truce in May, after a rapid escalation of tariffs had nearly paralyzed trade between the world's two largest economies.The US president said he would send out letters specifying the terms of the new deals ahead of a 9 July deadline to reimpose higher tariffs on countries around the world.Separately, US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said he expected the US would extend the existing pause on some of its most aggressive tariffs to allow trade talks with other countries to continue.The negotiations in London were triggered in part by US concerns that China was being too slow to release exports of its magnets and rare earth minerals, which are essential for manufacturing everything from smartphones to electric vehicles.Beijing in turn has criticized controls the US has put in place to limit the country's access to semiconductors and other related technologies linked to artificial intelligence (AI) and the Trump administration's plans to limit visas for Chinese students.Speaking to CNBC, Lutnick said the US had agreed to remove some ""counter-measures"" without being specific about the response.",Positive

US reviewing Aukus submarine pact as part of 'America First' agenda It comes as Australia faces pressure from the White House to dramatically lift its military spending.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy8d3d5l9l1o,"– The US has launched a review of its multi-billion dollar submarine deal with the UK and Australia, saying the security pact must fit its ""America First"" agenda.""The department is reviewing Aukus as part of ensuring that this initiative of the previous administration is aligned with the President's America First agenda,"" a US defense official told the BBC.Under the trilateral pact, widely seen as a response to the growing power of China, Australia is to get its first nuclear-powered subs from the US, before the allies create a new fleet by sharing cutting-edge tech.Both Australia and the UK - which did its own review last year - have sought to play down news of the US probe, saying it is natural for a new administration to reassess.The move comes as Australia faces pressure from the White House to lift its military spending, from 2% to 3.5% of GDP, a push so far resisted by Canberra.The deal represents a major upgrade to its military capabilities.Such submarines will be able to operate further and faster than the country's existing diesel-engine fleet and Australia would also be able to carry out long-range strikes against enemies for the first time.It is a big deal for the US to share what is often called the the ""crown jewels"" of its defense technology.But arming Australia has historically been viewed by Washington and Downing Street as essential to preserving peace in a region they themselves aren't a part of.The other concern the US might have is whether Australia would use the submarines they buy in the way the US wants them to, she said.Defense Minister Richard Marles, speaking to local Australian media on Thursday morning local time, said he was optimistic the deal would continue.",Positive

'I made the sign of victory for Siwar': Mother's relief as malnourished Gaza baby evacuated to Jordan,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn0g45z792do,"– ""The first and last goal of this trip is Siwar,"" said Saleh. ""We want to get her to a safe shore. I want to make sure she is safe and cured. She's my daughter, my own flesh and blood. And I'm so deeply worried about her.""

I saw King Abdullah's photo at the border and I felt so happy I got off the bus and made the sign of victory...for the sake of Siwar.""Back in April when the BBC first filmed Siwar at Nasser hospital in southern Gaza, her mother and doctor said she was suffering from malnutrition because the special milk formula she needed could not be found in sufficient quantity. Najwa said then she could not breastfeed Siwar because she herself was suffering from malnutrition. But with an Israeli blockade on aid, which was partially eased three weeks ago, and an escalating military offensive it was clear Siwar's condition needed more comprehensive testing and treatment.In a deal announced between King Abdullah and US President Donald Trump in February, Jordan offered to bring 2,000 seriously ill children to Amman for treatment.

In a series of statements, the city's police department said that those detained included 203 people arrested for failure to disperse, 17 for curfew violations, three for possession of a firearm, and one for assault with a deadly weapon on a police officer.
