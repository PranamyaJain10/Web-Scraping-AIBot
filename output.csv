"Names of 425,000 suspected Nazi collaborators published",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cj6z3g0d3x3o,"– The names of around 425,000 people suspected of collaborating with the Nazis during the German occupation of the Netherlands have been published online for the first time. The full records of these investigations were previously only accessible by visiting the Dutch National Archives in The Hague. The Huygens Institute, which helped digitise the archive, says this is a major barrier for people wishing to research the Netherlands' occupation, which lasted from its invasion in 1940 to 1945. The archive contains files on war criminals, the approximately 20,000 Dutch people who enlisted in the German armed forces, and alleged members of the National Socialist Movement (NSB) - the Dutch Nazi party. But it also contains the names of people who were found to be innocent.This is because the archive is comprised of files from the Special Jurisdiction, which from 1944 investigated suspected collaborators.The online database only contains the names of suspects - as well as the date and place of their birth - which are only searchable using specific personal details.It does not specify whether a particular person was found guilty, or what form of collaboration they were suspected of. Culture Minister Eppo Bruins wrote: ""Openness of archives is crucial for facing the effects of [the Netherlands'] difficult shared past and to process it as a society.""How much information made available online would be limited given privacy concerns, and those visiting the archive in person will not be allowed to make copies, he said. Bruins has expressed a wish to change the law to allow more information to be disclosed publicly.",Negative
