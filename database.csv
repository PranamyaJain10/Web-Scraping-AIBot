Diego Garcia, a remote island in the Indian Ocean, is a paradise of lush vegetation and white-sand beaches, surrounded by crystal blue waters.But this is no tourist destination. The island, which is administered from London, is at the center of a long-running territorial dispute between the UK and Mauritius, and negotiations have ramped up in recent weeks.The BBC gained unprecedented access to the island earlier this month. Diego Garcia, which is about 1,000 miles from the nearest landmass, features on lists of the world's most remote islands.To enter the island you need a permit, only granted to people with connections to the military facility or the British authority that runs the territory. Journalists have historically been barred.UK government lawyers brought a legal challenge to try to block the BBC from attending the hearing, and even when permission was granted following a ruling by the territory's Supreme Court, the US later objected, saying it would not provide food, transport or accommodation to all those attempting to reach the island for the case—including the judge and barristers.When permission was finally granted for me to spend five days on the island, it came with stringent restrictions.The US dollar is the accepted currency and the electricity sockets are American.While the territory is administered from London, most personnel and resources there are under the control of the US.The arrangement was rolled over and is set to expire in 2036.",Positive

Netanyahu's refusal reflected almost universal distrust of Palestinians inside Israel as well as his own ideology.It also torpedoed an ambitious American peace plan.President Biden's 'grand bargain' proposed that Israel would receive full diplomatic recognition by Saudi Arabia, the most influential Islamic country, in return for allowing Palestinian independence.The Biden plan fell at the first hurdle.

What could happen if Donald Trump drastically increases tariffs as he has promised to do?,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c20myx1erl6o,"– Donald Trump has pledged to drastically increase tariffs on foreign goods entering the US if he is elected president again.He has promised tariffs—a form of tax—of up to 20% on goods from other countries and 60% on all imports from China.Over the course of 2023, the US imported around $3,100bn of goods, equivalent to around 11% of US GDP.And tariffs imposed on those imports brought in $80bn in that year, around 2% of total US tax revenues.The political context for Trump's tariffs was longstanding concern about the loss of US manufacturing jobs to countries with lower labor costs, particularly after the signing of the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta) with Mexico in 1994 and the entry of China into the World Trade Organization in 2001.""Under my plan, American workers will no longer be worried about losing your jobs to foreign nations, instead, foreign nations will be worried about losing their jobs to America,"" he said on the campaign trail.The non-partisan Peterson Institute for International Economics has estimated Trump's new proposed tariffs would lower the incomes of Americans, with the impact ranging from around 4% for the poorest fifth to around 2% for the wealthiest fifth.A typical household in the middle of the US income distribution, the think tank estimates, would lose around $1,700 each year.Various researchers have also warned that another major round of tariffs from the US would risk another spike in domestic inflation.Trump imposed 25% tariffs on imported steel in 2018 to protect US producers.By 2020, total employment in the US steel sector was 80,000, still lower than the 84,000 it had been in 2018.",Negative

It was signed by Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and was supposed to be private, until it was leaked to Israeli journalists.It is a blueprint for an entirely different approach by Israel to the aid operation in Gaza— expediting it, rather than imposing restrictions.The hard facts in the US letter are a stark contrast to his emotive rhetoric.The European Union's chief diplomat and leading human rights groups have already accused Israel of using starvation as a weapon of war.Gallant set the tone of Israel's approach to humanitarian aid flows to Gaza two days after the Hamas attacks of 7 October 2023.He announced a ""complete siege"" of the Gaza Strip.The US is particularly concerned by ""recent actions by the Israeli government - including commercial imports, denying or impeding nearly 90% of humanitarian movements between northern and southern Gaza in September.""The Americans also criticise the way Israel slows the delivery of aid by imposing onerous rules, and make a number of specific demands: They want the removal of the restrictions on the use of closed lorries and containers, and to increase the number of vetted drivers to 400.The letter cannot have made easy reading for its two recipients, Yoav Gallant, Israel's defense minister, and Ron Dermer, its minister of strategic affairs, who is one of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's closest advisers.It even challenges Israel's long-standing attack on UNRWA, the UN agency that looks after Palestinian refugees.",Negative

Lidia Thorpe, who is now an independent after leaving the Greens over the party’s support for the Yes vote in the referendum—is unlikely to change tack. She thinks the King needs to play a bigger role in making good the ills of the past.Last year's referendum on a Voice to Parliament—which would have recognized First Nations people in the constitution and allowed them to form a body to advise the parliament—was a distraction from that goal. Australians resoundingly voted against the proposal and she was one of a minority of First Nations people who also voted no.She told the BBC at the time that the Voice was about ""assimilating us into the colonial constitution to make us nice, neat little Indigenous Australians that will continue to be oppressed by the coloniser.""I wanted to send a clear message to the King of England that he's not the King of this country, he's not my king, he's not sovereign,"" Thorpe told the BBC after being removed from the Great Hall after heckling.Whether or not you agree with Lidia Thorpe's approach—and some prominent Indigenous leaders have made it clear that they don't—the fact is that there are deep disparities between First Nations people and non-Indigenous Australians when it comes to indicators such as education, health, and life expectancy.Last year Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said a young Indigenous man was more likely to go to jail than university, which is borne out by statistics, as ABC showed.",Positive

""We know that after Earth first formed there was still a lot of debris flying around space that would be smashing into Earth,” says Prof Nadja Drabon from Harvard university, lead author of the new research.“But now we have found that life was really resilient in the wake of some of these giant impacts, and that it actually bloomed and thrived.""Imagine a rain cloud, but instead of water droplets coming down, it's like molten rock droplets raining out of the sky,” says Prof Drabon.A huge tsunami would have swept across the globe, ripped up the sea floor, and flooded coastlines.The 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami would have paled in comparison, suggests Prof Drabon.All that energy would have generated massive amounts of heat that boiled the oceans causing up to tens of meters of water to evaporate.The team also found evidence that early life was actually helped by the violent succession of rocks striking Earth in its early years, Prof Drabon says.“It seems that life after the impact actually encountered really favorable conditions that allowed it to bloom,” she explains.",Positive

Their cases will generally be closed completely at the end of the war.“This has turned Russia's law enforcement system upside down,” says Olga Romanova, the director of Russia Behind Bars—an NGO that provides legal assistance to detainees.“Police can now catch a man over a corpse of someone he has just killed. They tighten the handcuffs and then the killer says: ‘Oh wait, I want to go on a special military operation,’ and they close the criminal case.”We received a leaked recording of an investigator describing the advantages of signing a contract with the Russian army to someone whose husband had already been sentenced to three years for theft.It's not clear how many people accused of crimes have opted to fight instead of facing trial, but this shift in policy reflects Russia's need to reinforce troops while minimizing the number of other civilians it needs to mobilise.“Do Russians care about convicts or those who are in prison?

So why is it now scaling back immigration?,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cp9z5rpgkyeo,"– Canada has cast itself as a country open to newcomers, with immigration policies tailored to boost its population, fill labor gaps and settle refugees fleeing conflict from around the world.But in recent months, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has said he intends to significantly cut the number of immigrants allowed in Canada as public concern grows over inaccessible social services, high costs of living and unaffordable housing.It is a major shift for both the country and Trudeau, who ran in 2015 on a platform of embracing multiculturalism as a key part of Canadian identity.His announcement comes at the heels of dwindling public support for immigration in Canada. Trudeau and Immigration Minister Marc Miller presented their most stringent immigration cutbacks yet—a 21% reduction of permanent residents accepted into the country in 2025.The announcement follows other cuts to Canada's temporary resident programs, which include temporary foreign workers and international students.Explaining his shift in policy, Trudeau maintained that ""Canadians are justifiably proud"" of their immigration system.Canada has also rarely faced troubles experienced elsewhere with uncontrolled migration—a benefit of its geography, being surrounded by three oceans and the US to the south—and its immigration system was seen by the public as open and well-regulated.All of these concerns, he added, are underlined by a housing crisis that has affected Canadians across the country, where a shortage of available homes has driven both rent and home prices up for many.“People are going to see large numbers of (newcomers) coming in and housing shortages, and conclude that’s directly causal,” he said.Professor Donnelly noted that while Canada has seen some racist rhetoric around immigration, Canadians' changing attitudes are not primarily driven by the sentiments seen in European countries or in the neighboring United States.",Positive

The federal government established Indian boarding schools from 1819 until the 1970s that forcibly removed children from their homes and families.Ten days before the general election, Biden's apology at an event in Arizona also gave him a chance to show support for tribal nations in a swing state that the Democratic White House ticket won just by 10,000 votes in 2020. Under the Biden administration, the US Department of Interior launched its first-ever federal investigation of the Indian boarding school system to address its history.Interior Secretary Deb Haaland, the first Native American to serve as a cabinet secretary, went on a tour last year to speak with indigenous survivors.",Positive
