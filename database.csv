Diego Garcia, a remote island in the Indian Ocean, is a paradise of lush vegetation and white-sand beaches, surrounded by crystal blue waters.But this is no tourist destination. The island, which is administered from London, is at the center of a long-running territorial dispute between the UK and Mauritius, and negotiations have ramped up in recent weeks.The BBC gained unprecedented access to the island earlier this month. Diego Garcia, which is about 1,000 miles from the nearest landmass, features on lists of the world's most remote islands.To enter the island you need a permit, only granted to people with connections to the military facility or the British authority that runs the territory. Journalists have historically been barred.UK government lawyers brought a legal challenge to try to block the BBC from attending the hearing, and even when permission was granted following a ruling by the territory's Supreme Court, the US later objected, saying it would not provide food, transport or accommodation to all those attempting to reach the island for the case—including the judge and barristers.When permission was finally granted for me to spend five days on the island, it came with stringent restrictions.The US dollar is the accepted currency and the electricity sockets are American.While the territory is administered from London, most personnel and resources there are under the control of the US.The arrangement was rolled over and is set to expire in 2036.",Positive

Netanyahu's refusal reflected almost universal distrust of Palestinians inside Israel as well as his own ideology.It also torpedoed an ambitious American peace plan.President Biden's 'grand bargain' proposed that Israel would receive full diplomatic recognition by Saudi Arabia, the most influential Islamic country, in return for allowing Palestinian independence.The Biden plan fell at the first hurdle.

2024-10-15,Would Donald Trump’s taxes on trade hurt US consumers? What could happen if Donald Trump drastically increases tariffs as he has promised to do?,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c20myx1erl6o,"– Donald Trump has pledged to drastically increase tariffs on foreign goods entering the US if he is elected president again.He has promised tariffs—a form of tax—of up to 20% on goods from other countries and 60% on all imports from China.Over the course of 2023, the US imported around $3,100bn of goods, equivalent to around 11% of US GDP.And tariffs imposed on those imports brought in $80bn in that year, around 2% of total US tax revenues.The political context for Trump's tariffs was longstanding concern about the loss of US manufacturing jobs to countries with lower labor costs, particularly after the signing of the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta) with Mexico in 1994 and the entry of China into the World Trade Organization in 2001.""Under my plan, American workers will no longer be worried about losing your jobs to foreign nations, instead, foreign nations will be worried about losing their jobs to America,"" he said on the campaign trail.The non-partisan Peterson Institute for International Economics has estimated Trump's new proposed tariffs would lower the incomes of Americans, with the impact ranging from around 4% for the poorest fifth to around 2% for the wealthiest fifth.A typical household in the middle of the US income distribution, the think tank estimates, would lose around $1,700 each year.Various researchers have also warned that another major round of tariffs from the US would risk another spike in domestic inflation.Trump imposed 25% tariffs on imported steel in 2018 to protect US producers.By 2020, total employment in the US steel sector was 80,000, still lower than the 84,000 it had been in 2018.",Negative
