Diego Garcia, a remote island in the Indian Ocean, is a paradise of lush vegetation and white-sand beaches, surrounded by crystal blue waters.But this is no tourist destination. The island, which is administered from London, is at the center of a long-running territorial dispute between the UK and Mauritius, and negotiations have ramped up in recent weeks.The BBC gained unprecedented access to the island earlier this month. Diego Garcia, which is about 1,000 miles from the nearest landmass, features on lists of the world's most remote islands.To enter the island you need a permit, only granted to people with connections to the military facility or the British authority that runs the territory. Journalists have historically been barred.UK government lawyers brought a legal challenge to try to block the BBC from attending the hearing, and even when permission was granted following a ruling by the territory's Supreme Court, the US later objected, saying it would not provide food, transport or accommodation to all those attempting to reach the island for the case—including the judge and barristers.When permission was finally granted for me to spend five days on the island, it came with stringent restrictions.The US dollar is the accepted currency and the electricity sockets are American.While the territory is administered from London, most personnel and resources there are under the control of the US.The arrangement was rolled over and is set to expire in 2036.",Positive

Netanyahu's refusal reflected almost universal distrust of Palestinians inside Israel as well as his own ideology.It also torpedoed an ambitious American peace plan.President Biden's 'grand bargain' proposed that Israel would receive full diplomatic recognition by Saudi Arabia, the most influential Islamic country, in return for allowing Palestinian independence.The Biden plan fell at the first hurdle.
