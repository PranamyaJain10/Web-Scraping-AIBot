Diego Garcia, a remote island in the Indian Ocean, is a paradise of lush vegetation and white-sand beaches, surrounded by crystal blue waters.But this is no tourist destination. The island, which is administered from London, is at the center of a long-running territorial dispute between the UK and Mauritius, and negotiations have ramped up in recent weeks.The BBC gained unprecedented access to the island earlier this month. Diego Garcia, which is about 1,000 miles from the nearest landmass, features on lists of the world's most remote islands.To enter the island you need a permit, only granted to people with connections to the military facility or the British authority that runs the territory. Journalists have historically been barred.UK government lawyers brought a legal challenge to try to block the BBC from attending the hearing, and even when permission was granted following a ruling by the territory's Supreme Court, the US later objected, saying it would not provide food, transport or accommodation to all those attempting to reach the island for the case—including the judge and barristers.When permission was finally granted for me to spend five days on the island, it came with stringent restrictions.The US dollar is the accepted currency and the electricity sockets are American.While the territory is administered from London, most personnel and resources there are under the control of the US.The arrangement was rolled over and is set to expire in 2036.",Positive

Netanyahu's refusal reflected almost universal distrust of Palestinians inside Israel as well as his own ideology.It also torpedoed an ambitious American peace plan.President Biden's 'grand bargain' proposed that Israel would receive full diplomatic recognition by Saudi Arabia, the most influential Islamic country, in return for allowing Palestinian independence.The Biden plan fell at the first hurdle.

What could happen if Donald Trump drastically increases tariffs as he has promised to do?,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c20myx1erl6o,"– Donald Trump has pledged to drastically increase tariffs on foreign goods entering the US if he is elected president again.He has promised tariffs—a form of tax—of up to 20% on goods from other countries and 60% on all imports from China.Over the course of 2023, the US imported around $3,100bn of goods, equivalent to around 11% of US GDP.And tariffs imposed on those imports brought in $80bn in that year, around 2% of total US tax revenues.The political context for Trump's tariffs was longstanding concern about the loss of US manufacturing jobs to countries with lower labor costs, particularly after the signing of the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta) with Mexico in 1994 and the entry of China into the World Trade Organization in 2001.""Under my plan, American workers will no longer be worried about losing your jobs to foreign nations, instead, foreign nations will be worried about losing their jobs to America,"" he said on the campaign trail.The non-partisan Peterson Institute for International Economics has estimated Trump's new proposed tariffs would lower the incomes of Americans, with the impact ranging from around 4% for the poorest fifth to around 2% for the wealthiest fifth.A typical household in the middle of the US income distribution, the think tank estimates, would lose around $1,700 each year.Various researchers have also warned that another major round of tariffs from the US would risk another spike in domestic inflation.Trump imposed 25% tariffs on imported steel in 2018 to protect US producers.By 2020, total employment in the US steel sector was 80,000, still lower than the 84,000 it had been in 2018.",Negative

It was signed by Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and was supposed to be private, until it was leaked to Israeli journalists.It is a blueprint for an entirely different approach by Israel to the aid operation in Gaza— expediting it, rather than imposing restrictions.The hard facts in the US letter are a stark contrast to his emotive rhetoric.The European Union's chief diplomat and leading human rights groups have already accused Israel of using starvation as a weapon of war.Gallant set the tone of Israel's approach to humanitarian aid flows to Gaza two days after the Hamas attacks of 7 October 2023.He announced a ""complete siege"" of the Gaza Strip.The US is particularly concerned by ""recent actions by the Israeli government - including commercial imports, denying or impeding nearly 90% of humanitarian movements between northern and southern Gaza in September.""The Americans also criticise the way Israel slows the delivery of aid by imposing onerous rules, and make a number of specific demands: They want the removal of the restrictions on the use of closed lorries and containers, and to increase the number of vetted drivers to 400.The letter cannot have made easy reading for its two recipients, Yoav Gallant, Israel's defense minister, and Ron Dermer, its minister of strategic affairs, who is one of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's closest advisers.It even challenges Israel's long-standing attack on UNRWA, the UN agency that looks after Palestinian refugees.",Negative

Lidia Thorpe, who is now an independent after leaving the Greens over the party’s support for the Yes vote in the referendum—is unlikely to change tack. She thinks the King needs to play a bigger role in making good the ills of the past.Last year's referendum on a Voice to Parliament—which would have recognized First Nations people in the constitution and allowed them to form a body to advise the parliament—was a distraction from that goal. Australians resoundingly voted against the proposal and she was one of a minority of First Nations people who also voted no.She told the BBC at the time that the Voice was about ""assimilating us into the colonial constitution to make us nice, neat little Indigenous Australians that will continue to be oppressed by the coloniser.""I wanted to send a clear message to the King of England that he's not the King of this country, he's not my king, he's not sovereign,"" Thorpe told the BBC after being removed from the Great Hall after heckling.Whether or not you agree with Lidia Thorpe's approach—and some prominent Indigenous leaders have made it clear that they don't—the fact is that there are deep disparities between First Nations people and non-Indigenous Australians when it comes to indicators such as education, health, and life expectancy.Last year Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said a young Indigenous man was more likely to go to jail than university, which is borne out by statistics, as ABC showed.",Positive

""We know that after Earth first formed there was still a lot of debris flying around space that would be smashing into Earth,” says Prof Nadja Drabon from Harvard university, lead author of the new research.“But now we have found that life was really resilient in the wake of some of these giant impacts, and that it actually bloomed and thrived.""Imagine a rain cloud, but instead of water droplets coming down, it's like molten rock droplets raining out of the sky,” says Prof Drabon.A huge tsunami would have swept across the globe, ripped up the sea floor, and flooded coastlines.The 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami would have paled in comparison, suggests Prof Drabon.All that energy would have generated massive amounts of heat that boiled the oceans causing up to tens of meters of water to evaporate.The team also found evidence that early life was actually helped by the violent succession of rocks striking Earth in its early years, Prof Drabon says.“It seems that life after the impact actually encountered really favorable conditions that allowed it to bloom,” she explains.",Positive

Their cases will generally be closed completely at the end of the war.“This has turned Russia's law enforcement system upside down,” says Olga Romanova, the director of Russia Behind Bars—an NGO that provides legal assistance to detainees.“Police can now catch a man over a corpse of someone he has just killed. They tighten the handcuffs and then the killer says: ‘Oh wait, I want to go on a special military operation,’ and they close the criminal case.”We received a leaked recording of an investigator describing the advantages of signing a contract with the Russian army to someone whose husband had already been sentenced to three years for theft.It's not clear how many people accused of crimes have opted to fight instead of facing trial, but this shift in policy reflects Russia's need to reinforce troops while minimizing the number of other civilians it needs to mobilise.“Do Russians care about convicts or those who are in prison?

So why is it now scaling back immigration?,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cp9z5rpgkyeo,"– Canada has cast itself as a country open to newcomers, with immigration policies tailored to boost its population, fill labor gaps and settle refugees fleeing conflict from around the world.But in recent months, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has said he intends to significantly cut the number of immigrants allowed in Canada as public concern grows over inaccessible social services, high costs of living and unaffordable housing.It is a major shift for both the country and Trudeau, who ran in 2015 on a platform of embracing multiculturalism as a key part of Canadian identity.His announcement comes at the heels of dwindling public support for immigration in Canada. Trudeau and Immigration Minister Marc Miller presented their most stringent immigration cutbacks yet—a 21% reduction of permanent residents accepted into the country in 2025.The announcement follows other cuts to Canada's temporary resident programs, which include temporary foreign workers and international students.Explaining his shift in policy, Trudeau maintained that ""Canadians are justifiably proud"" of their immigration system.Canada has also rarely faced troubles experienced elsewhere with uncontrolled migration—a benefit of its geography, being surrounded by three oceans and the US to the south—and its immigration system was seen by the public as open and well-regulated.All of these concerns, he added, are underlined by a housing crisis that has affected Canadians across the country, where a shortage of available homes has driven both rent and home prices up for many.“People are going to see large numbers of (newcomers) coming in and housing shortages, and conclude that’s directly causal,” he said.Professor Donnelly noted that while Canada has seen some racist rhetoric around immigration, Canadians' changing attitudes are not primarily driven by the sentiments seen in European countries or in the neighboring United States.",Positive

The federal government established Indian boarding schools from 1819 until the 1970s that forcibly removed children from their homes and families.Ten days before the general election, Biden's apology at an event in Arizona also gave him a chance to show support for tribal nations in a swing state that the Democratic White House ticket won just by 10,000 votes in 2020. Under the Biden administration, the US Department of Interior launched its first-ever federal investigation of the Indian boarding school system to address its history.Interior Secretary Deb Haaland, the first Native American to serve as a cabinet secretary, went on a tour last year to speak with indigenous survivors.",Positive

Prof Stoyle's research suggests that the court documents from the time contained a spelling mistake, and Alice Molland might actually have been called Avis Molland.He said: ""Court records from the 17th century were written in Latin, and in this form it would only have taken a single mis-stroke of the clerk of the court's pen to transform 'Avicia' (Avis) into 'Alicia' (Alice).""Almost nothing is known about Alice's life and attempts to illuminate it have failed.""Molland was an unusual name in Exeter, so when Prof Stoyle saw a reference to an Avis Molland in some local archives, he was struck by its close resemblance.He said: ""I immediately asked myself, did Alice Molland ever exist? Is Alice, in fact, Avis?"" According to records from the time, Avis Molland had been married with three children - but they all died.""By the time of the 1685 trial, Avis Molland was a poor, middle-aged widow, who was burdened with loss - precisely the kind of woman who was likely to be accused of witchcraft in early modern England.He added circumstantial evidence suggested Avis had been imprisoned at Exeter Castle at the same time as the trial for Alice was listed.Had there been a simple spelling mistake, the last executed witches in 1693.",Negative

Jones went on to forge an era-defining partnership with Michael Jackson; oversee 1985's We Are the World, one of the biggest-selling songs of all time; craft hits for acts like Chaka Khan and Donna Summer; and work with the biggest names in hip-hop. Jones had always been a survivor.He grew up in the shadow of the Great Depression in the 1930s on the South Side of Chicago.His mother was taken to a psychiatric institution when he was seven and his father worked as a carpenter for notorious gangsters the Jones Boys.At the age of 14, he made friends with another then-unknown musician called Ray Charles, who became a lifelong collaborator.Jones saw a superstar quality in Jackson and became his producer and mentor, first on 1979's Off the Wall, which was a major hit, and then 1982's Thriller, which reached new heights of commercial and critical success, and made Jackson the undisputed King of Pop. Jones also worked with many other big names of the age, including Aretha Franklin, Louis Armstrong and Sammy Davis Jr.",Positive

""I thought I was going to die,"" he said, testifying he realized his mistake when he rolled over Mr Hill's body and saw there was no weapon. ""I was horrified."" Coy had responded to a complaint about someone inside a running vehicle at about 1:30 in the morning when he first encountered Mr Hill, sitting inside an SUV. The former officer said Mr Hill seemed dismissive, and that he was suspicious when Mr Hill went to a nearby house and knocked on the door, before entering through the garage. An investigation later found the house belonged to a friend of Mr Hill's. Coy used a flashlight to spot Mr Hill in the garage and ordered him to come out. Police body camera footage showed Mr Hill then come out of the garage holding a mobile phone in his left hand, his right hand not visible, seconds before he was gunned down by Coy. ""We're taught do what the cops tell you to do and you can survive the encounter,"" said prosecutor Anthony Pierson during closing arguments. Coy did not visibly react to the verdict, according to AP News. Weeks after Mr Hill's shooting, the Columbus police chief resigned under mounting scrutiny over a series of fatal shootings of unarmed black men and children.",Negative

But can its potential be realized?Leigh Curyer had been working in uranium mining for nearly two decades when he noticed a striking shift.In 2011, the Fukushima nuclear plant disaster in Japan badly damaged the world's view of nuclear power, and the price for the heavy metal—a critical component for nuclear fuel— cratered.But the last five years has seen a reversal, with the global price of uranium spiking by more than 200% of this year's top-performing commodities.Canada's role in supplying the commodity is made more urgent by Russia's invasion of Ukraine, particularly for the US, which had relied heavily on Russian-supplied enriched uranium to fire up its commercial nuclear reactors.Uranium can be found around the world, though it is heavily present in Canada, Australia, and Kazakhstan.Canada has set strict rules for the sale of its uranium to other countries, Prof Piro said, and mandates it only be used for nuclear power generation.The country is also referred to as a ""tier-one nuclear nation,"" he said, due to its capability to produce nuclear fuel from the mining to the manufacturing stage.Once mined, uranium is milled to produce what is called calcined yellowcake, and then enriched, either at facilities in Canada or overseas, to create fuel for nuclear reactors.Mr Curyer believes his mine could prove to be ""absolutely critical"" to America's nuclear energy future, as the US is now hunting for alternatives to Russia, including by ramping up exploration on its own soil.",Negative

House Speaker Mike Johnson, another devoted Trump loyalist, called Gaetz an ""accomplished attorney.""The department also investigated Gaetz himself.Last year, it declined to bring charges over allegations he violated sex-trafficking laws during a trip he took to the Bahamas with paid escorts.All this makes him an unlikely choice for a position that typically goes to more senior politicians, well versed in law.Gaetz, 42, has a law degree and worked for a Florida law firm before his eight years in Congress. Trump in his first term picked US Senator Jeff Sessions, and later Bill Barr, who had decades of experience in Republican presidential administrations.",Positive

Roberson has long maintained his innocence. His lawyers say new evidence shows the child died of complications from pneumonia.Just hours before Roberson, 57, was set to be executed on 17 October, a bipartisan group of lawmakers in the Texas House of Representatives issued a subpoena for him to testify in a hearing that would take place after his execution date.A Travis County judge then issued a temporary restraining order to stop the execution going ahead before the hearing took place.But on Friday, weeks after that subpoena was issued, the Texas Supreme Court said that group of lawmakers did not have the authority to override Roberson's scheduled execution with a subpoena and the execution should now move forward. Roberson was originally sentenced to death in 2003 for the death of his daughter, Nikki Curtis. A post-mortem examination found she died of injuries from abuse but Roberson says his daughter fell out of her bed and when he returned hours later she was not breathing.

Jim Caviezel, an actor who played Jesus in Mel Gibson's The Passion of the Christ, proclaimed, albeit jokingly, that Trump was ""the new Moses.""

Saturday's looting was first reported by Reuters news agency, which cited an Unrwa official in Gaza as saying that the convoy was instructed by Israeli authorities to ""depart at short notice via an unfamiliar route"" from Kerem Shalom.Gaza's Hamas-run interior ministry said its security staff killed ""more than 20 members of gangs involved in stealing aid trucks"" in an operation carried out in cooperation with ""tribal committees"", a network of traditional family clans.Lazzarini said he could not comment on the route when asked at a news conference in Geneva on Monday, but he confirmed the looting and said: ""We have been warning a long time ago about the total breakdown of civil order.""Until four or five months ago, we still had local capacity, people who were escorting the convoy.This has completely gone, which means we are in an environment where local gangs, local families, are struggling among each other to take control of any business or any activities taking place in the south.It has become an impossible environment to operate in.""",Negative

Multiply this on the global scale and the aviation industry would need to plant roughly 100 billion mature trees each year to offset its emissions.The Jet Zero Strategy estimates that this, together with other fuel efficiency improvements, could cut emissions by as much as 15% by 2050. Aviation’s CO2 emissions come primarily through jet engines using carbon-rich fossil fuels, which produce CO2 when burned, so there have been attempts to create an alternative type made from renewable biomass and waste resources, known as Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF).The first flight ran between London and Amsterdam in 2008 using fuel derived from a mixture of Brazilian babassu nuts and coconuts.",Positive

It is not just a renovation after the fire, but a complete overhaul including removing decades of crud and soot built up since the last restoration. Here we take a look at some of the key features of the repair work and how it was achieved: The collapse of the spire was the climax of the 2019 fire. Many people thought it was medieval, but in fact the original was taken down in the 1790s because it was deemed dangerous. The vast majority of the masonry was undamaged, but it was covered not just in age-old accretions of dust and dirt from the past, but also in a layer of soot and lead powder from the fire. To rebuild the vaulted ceiling beneath where the spire had stood, masons had to relearn the principles of Gothic architecture—using a wooden frame to put the stones in place and crowning it all with the keystone. Many of the exterior sculptures—including the famous (but not medieval) gargoyles and chimaeras—were damaged by high-pressure hoses used to fight the fire.",Negative

Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton's lawsuit accuses Dr Margaret Daley Carpenter of New York of posting the medication to the 20-year-old woman.It is alleged she took the pills when she was nine-weeks pregnant, violating Texas's ban on nearly all abortions.But Dr Carpenter, who could not be reached for comment, may be protected by New York's so-called shield laws, which aim to legally safeguard doctors who provide abortion pills to patients in other states.The legislation means New York will not co-operate with any other state's effort to prosecute, or otherwise penalise a doctor for providing abortion pills, as long as the doctor complies with New York law.New York is one of eight Democratic-led states with shield laws.

I was just sweating,"" James said, adding that he also ended up wetting his pants when some fighters hit him with their guns—and laughed.Ghana's National Commission on Civic Education, a government body which is spearheading a public campaign to prevent young people from joining the jihadists, told the BBC that it was aware of James' experience.James, who is in his 30s and follows a traditional African religion, said the insurgents later attempted to recruit him, enticing him with the allure of power by saying he could one day become the commander of a battalion.""The commander brought out a sack. It contained different weapons, AK-47, M16, and G3 [rifles],"" James added.He said he was lucky to be released about two weeks later after he begged for his freedom, claiming that he had a sick child at home and promising the camp commander that he would become his recruiting-sergeant in Ghana—a promise he says he never kept.Jihadists linked to both al-Qaeda and the Islamic State (IS) group operate in the region.",Positive

Chrystia Freeland—the former deputy prime minister and finance minister—quit her posts on Monday with an open letter to Trudeau, in which she outlined disagreements she had with him on spending and ""the best path forward for Canada.""These disagreements, she said, were underscored by the threat of tariffs on Canadian goods from incoming US President Donald Trump— tariffs that economists say could deal Canada a devastating economic blow.Trudeau told fellow Liberal members of parliament (MPs)—including some who had directly called for him to step down—that he would take time to reflect, according to multiple reports.Parliament was most recently prorogued by Trudeau in August 2020, when his government was facing an ethics scandal over its handling of a contract with a charity.It was also used to avoid a no-confidence vote by Trudeau's predecessor, Conservative Prime Minister Stephen Harper, who prorogued parliament in December 2008 when federal opposition parties sought to form a coalition government. Trudeau has been leader of the Liberal Party of Canada since 2013, and Canada's prime minister for just over nine years, since 2015.Under the party's constitution, the leader can tender his or her resignation at any time.Trudeau could also choose to stay in his post until that new leader is elected.Once a new leader is appointed, Trudeau would have to relinquish his prime ministerial powers and hand them over to his successor.
